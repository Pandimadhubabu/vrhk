### spaCy meets PyTorch-Transformers: Fine-tune BERT, XLNet and GPT-2 路 Blog 路 Explosion

Huge transformer models like BERT, GPT-2 and XLNet have set a new standard for accuracy on almost every NLP leaderboard. You can now use these models in spaCy, via a new interface library we've developed that connects spaCy to HuggingFace's awesome PyTorch implementations.
