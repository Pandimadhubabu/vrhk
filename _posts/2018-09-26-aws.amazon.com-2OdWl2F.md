### Segmenting brain tissue using Apache MXNet with Amazon SageMaker and AWS Greengrass ML Inference – Part 1 | Amazon Web Services

Annotation and segmentation of medical images is a laborious endeavor that can be automated in part via deep learning (DL) techniques. These approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results in generic segmentation tasks, the goal of which is to classify images at the pixel level. In Part 1 of this blog post, we demonstrate how to train […]
