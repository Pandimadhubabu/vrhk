### Enhanced text classification and word vectors using Amazon SageMaker BlazingText | Amazon Web Services

Today, we are launching several new features for the Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm. Many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation require the text data to be converted into real-valued vectors. Customers have been using BlazingText’s highly optimized implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm, for learning these vectors from […]
