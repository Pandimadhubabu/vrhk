excerpt: "When Amazon debuted Alexa back in 2014, it hardly looked like a threat to Apple's established \"personal digital assistant\" Siri. Four years earlier, Apple bought Siri for $200 million, debuting the iPhone 4S in 2011 as the first phone with an AI assistant. Everyone expected Siri to improve over time. Instead, Siri's cofounders left Apple, and Siri bounced from one Apple executive to another, and then another, stumbling forward as Alexa smoothly plowed ahead."
