excerpt: "Over the past few years, natural language interfaces have been transforming the way we interact with technology. Voice assistants in particular have had strong adoption in cases where it’s simpler to speak than write or use a complex user interface. This becomes particularly relevant for IoT, where devices often don’t have touchscreens, making voice a natural interaction mechanism. And since speaking doesn’t require adaptation (unlike learning to use a new app or device), we can hope for a larger adoption of technology across all age groups."

### Benchmarking Natural Language Understanding Systems

Over the past few years, natural language interfaces have been transforming the way we interact with technology. Voice assistants in particular have had strong adoption in cases where it’s simpler to speak than write or use a complex user interface. This becomes particularly relevant for IoT, where devices often don’t have touchscreens, making voice a natural interaction mechanism. And since speaking doesn’t require adaptation (unlike learning to use a new app or device), we can hope for a larger adoption of technology across all age groups.
