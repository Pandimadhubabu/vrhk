excerpt: "It's tempting to think AI adoption is limited by the technology itself. Headlines declaring the rise of robot doctors and approaching Singularity, contrasted with humorous memes of robots falling over, make us fear and sometimes doubt its capabilities. In practice, however, decades-old AI technology could unlock significant value, though many companies still have yet to adopt it. This is because the adoption of AI is determined by risk and trust. Thinking about AI adoption in this way enables us to more accurately anticipate opportunities for AI startups."
