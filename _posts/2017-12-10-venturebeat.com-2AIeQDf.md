### AI won’t destroy us, and Tesla is proof

Ignore the noise about a “terminator scenario” where machines become self-aware and seek to destroy their flawed human masters. Those of us who live and work in the “salt mines” of machine learning and artificial intelligence are almost universally unafraid. Still, a few well-known technical folk heroes continue to push this "sky-is-falling" narrative. The most prolific of them is Elon Musk, famed founder of Tesla and SpaceX. Not only do I think he’s wrong, I think his own company, Tesla Motors, is a compelling proof point against his argument.
