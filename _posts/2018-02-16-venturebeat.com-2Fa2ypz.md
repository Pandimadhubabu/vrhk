excerpt: "As Apple's HomePod has been out for a week, most of the news, reviews, and early problems have already been discussed ad nauseum. But you might have missed two unusual articles from Yahoo's David Pogue, whose real world HomePod listening test last Saturday created enough controversy to merit a \"readers weigh in\" followup today. Having praised HomePod's audio in his initial review, Pogue discovered that a panel of listeners preferred the Sonos One or Google Home Max, instead. When he published that finding, some of his readers freaked out, leading him to dive deeper into his testing methodology -- and other testers' results, as well."

### HomePod listening tests reveal the grimy truth about audio reviews

As Apple's HomePod has been out for a week, most of the news, reviews, and early problems have already been discussed ad nauseum. But you might have missed two unusual articles from Yahoo's David Pogue, whose real world HomePod listening test last Saturday created enough controversy to merit a "readers weigh in" followup today. Having praised HomePod's audio in his initial review, Pogue discovered that a panel of listeners preferred the Sonos One or Google Home Max, instead. When he published that finding, some of his readers freaked out, leading him to dive deeper into his testing methodology -- and other testers' results, as well.
