excerpt: "June 16, 2019, Long Beach, CA



Held in conjunction with IEEE CVPR 2019



Main theme: Embedded Vision for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)



UAVs with embedded and real-time vision processing capabilities have proven to be highly versatile autonomous robotic platforms in a variety of environments and for different tasks. The workshop aims at collecting and discussing next-generation approaches for online and onboard visual systems embedded on UAVs in order to elaborate a holistic picture of the state of the art in this field, and also to reveal remaining challenges and issues. The discussion of these topics will identify next steps in this research area for both young researchers as well as senior scientists. The invited speakers from academia will highlight past and current research and the invited speakers from industry will help closing the loop how research efforts are and will be perceived for industrial applications. Topics of interest include vision-based navigation, vision-based (multi-)sensor-fusion, online reconstruction, collaborative vision algorithms for navigation and environment perception, and related topics.



Important Dates



Paper submission: March 11, 2019  March 18, 2019 Demo abstract submission: March 11, 2019  March 18, 2019 Notification to the authors: April 3, 2019Camera ready paper: April 10, 2019



Paper submission:  guidelines: 



For paper submission, please refer to CVPR guidelines.For demo abstract submission, authors are encouraged to submit an abstract with up to 4 pages.Call for Papers (PDF file): Download



Awards



Best paper award sponsored by NAVER LABS Europe: USD 1000







Demos



EVW will have live demonstrations of embedded vision prototypes and solutions. This year, we plan dedicated poster and demonstration slots during which authors, engineers, and researchers can showcase their prototypes with real-time implementations of vision systems on embedded computing platforms for UAVs and other applications to a wide audience with good interaction opportunities. Demos related to UAVs are particularly encouraged, and we will make special efforts to meet the requirements of the demonstrators. Additionally, we invite abstracts, independent of the paper submissions, to present your demonstrations during the workshop.



Topics



Research papers are solicited in, but not limited to, the following topics and with relevance particularly to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles:



New trends and challenges in embedded visual processing for UAV applications, including localization, navigation, and image-based perceptionAnalysis of vision problems specific to embedded systemsAnalysis of embedded systems issues specific to computer visionArtificial intelligence hardware and software architectures for visual exploitation (for example deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and lightweight convolutional networks)Embedded vision for UAVs (industrial, mobile and consumer)Advanced assistance systems and autonomous navigation frameworksAugmented and Virtual RealityLarge-scale computer vision problems including object recognition, scene analysis, industrial and medical applicationsNew trends in programmable processors for vision and computational imagingApplications of and algorithms for embedded vision on:Massively parallel platforms such as GPUs (PC, embedded and mobile)Programmable platforms such as DSPs and multicore SoCsReconfigurable platforms such as FPGAs and SoCs with reconfigurable logicSwarms of mobile aerial platformsVision-based client devices for the Internet of Things (IoT)Mixed reality on mobile devicesEmbedded vision for 3D reconstruction and (live) data streamsBiologically-inspired vision and embedded systemsComputer vision applications distributed between embedded devices and serversEducational methods for embedded visionHardware enhancements (lens, imager, processor) that impact vision applicationsSoftware enhancements (OS, middleware, vision libraries, development tools) that impact embedded vision applicationPerformance metrics for evaluating embedded systemsHybrid embedded systems combining vision and other sensor modalitiesSpecial Journal Issue on Embedded Computer Vision



All of the previous Workshops on Embedded (Computer) Vision (ECVW and EVW) were held in conjunction with CVPR, with the exception of the fifth, which was held in conjunction with ICCV 2009. These events were very successful, and selected workshop papers have been published in several special issues of major journals (EURASIP Journal on Embedded Systems, CVIU and Springer monographs titled Embedded Computer Vision). This year, we also plan to organize a special issue for selected papers.
