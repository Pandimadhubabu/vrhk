excerpt: "In this blog post, I’ll show you how to use multiple pre-trained models with Apache MXNet. Why would you want to try multiple models? Why not just pick the one with the best accuracy? As we will see later in the blog post, even though these models have been trained on the same data set and optimized for maximum accuracy, they do behave slightly differently on specific images."

As we will see later in the blog post, even though these models have been trained on the same data set and optimized for maximum accuracy, they do behave slightly differently on specific images.
