excerpt: "When is a door not a door? When a computer says it is a jar!&hellip;Researchers analyze neural network &ldquo;hallucinations&rdquo; to create more robust systems&hellip;Researchers with the University of California at Berkeley and Boston University have devised a new way to measure how neural networks sometimes generate &lsquo;hallucinations&rsquo; when attempting to caption images. &ldquo;Image captioning models often &ldquo;hallucinate&rdquo; objects that may appear in a given context, like e.g. a bench here.&rdquo; Developing a better understanding of why such hallucinations occur &ndash; and how to prevent them occurring &ndash; is crucial to the development of more robust and widely used AI systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring hallucinations: The researchers propose &lsquo;CHAIR&rsquo; (Caption Hallucination Assessment with Image Relevance) as a way to assess how well systems generate captions in response to images. CHAIR calculates what proportion of generated words correspond to the contents of an image, according to the ground truth sentences and the output of object segmentation and labelling algorithms. So, for example, in a picture of a small puppy in a basket, you would give a system fewer points for giving the label &ldquo;a small puppy in a basket with cats&rdquo;, compared to &ldquo;a small puppy in a basket&rdquo;. In evaluations they find that on one test set &ldquo;anywhere between 7.4% and 17.5% include a hallucinated object&rdquo;.&nbsp; Strange correlations: Analyzing what causes these hallucinations is difficult. For instance, the researchers note that &ldquo;we find no obvious correlation between the average length of the generated captions and the hallucination rate&rdquo;. There is some more correlation among hallucinated objects, though. &ldquo;Across all models the super-category Furniture is hallucinated most often, accounting for 20-50% of all hallucinated objects. Other common super-categories are Outdoor objects, Sports and Kitchenware,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;The dining table is the most frequently hallucinated object across all models&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: If we are going to deploy lots of neural network-based systems into society then it is crucial that we understand the weaknesses and pathologies of such systems; analyses like this give us a clearer notion of the limits of today&rsquo;s technology and also indicate lines of research people could pursue to increase the robustness of such systems. &ldquo;We argue that the design and training of captioning models should be guided not only by cross-entropy loss or standard sentence metrics, but also by image relevance,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Object Hallucination in Image Captioning (Arxiv).
Humans! What are they good for? Absolutely&hellip; something!?&hellip;Advanced cognitive skills? Good. Psycho-motor skills? You may want to retrain&hellip;Michael Osborne, co-director of the Oxford Martin Programme on Technology and Unemployment, has given a presentation about the Future of Work. Osborn attained some level of notoriety within ML a while ago for publishing a study that said 47% of jobs could be at risk of automation. Since then he has been further fleshing out his ideas; a new presentation from him sees him analyze some typical occupations in the UK and try to estimate their probably for increased future demand for these roles. The findings aren&rsquo;t encouraging: Osborne&rsquo;s method predicts &nbsp;a low probability demand for new truck drivers in the UK, but a much higher demand for waiters and waitresses. &nbsp;&nbsp;What skills should you learn: If you want to fare well in an AI-first economy, then you should invest in advanced cognitive skills such as: judgement and decision making, systems evaluation, deductive reasoning, and so on. The sorts of skills which will be of less importance over time (for humans, at least), will be &lsquo;psycho-motor&rsquo; skills: control precision, manual dexterity, &nbsp;night vision, sound localization, and so on. (A meta-problem here is that many of the people in jobs that demand psycho-motor skills don&rsquo;t get the opportunity to develop the advanced cognitive skills that it is thought the future economy will demand.&nbsp; Why it matters: Analyzing how AI will and won&rsquo;t change employment is crucial work whose findings will determine the policy of many governments. The problems being surfaced by researchers such as Osborne is that the rapidity of AI&rsquo;s progress, combined with its tendency to automate an increasingly broad range of tasks, threatens traditional notions of employment.

What&rsquo;s cooler than 1,000 furniture models? 1 million ones. And more, in InteriorNet:&hellip;Massive new dataset gives researchers new benchmark to test systems against&hellip;Researchers with Imperial College London and Chinese furnishing-VR startup Kujiale, have released InteriorNet, a large-scale dataset of photographs of complex, realistic interiors. InteriorNet contains around 1 million CAD models of different types of furniture and furnishing, which over 1,100 professional designers have subsequently used to create around 22 million room layouts. Each of these scenes can also be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions and contexts due to the use of an inbuilt simulator called ViSim, which ships with the dataset and has also been released by the researchers. Purely based on the furniture contents this is one of the single largest datasets I am aware of for 3D scene composition and understanding.&nbsp; Things that make you go &lsquo;hmm&rsquo;: In the acknowledgements section of the InteriorNet website the researchers not only thank Kujiale for providing them with the furniture models but also for access to &ldquo;GPU/CPU clusters&rdquo; &ndash; could this be a pattern for future private-public collaborations where along with sharing expertise and financial resources the private sector also shares compute resources; that would make sense given the ballooning computational demands of many new AI techniques. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: InteriorNet: Mega-scale Multi-sensor Photo-realistic Indoor Scenes Dataset (website).
Lockheed Martin launches &lsquo;AlphaPilot&rsquo; competition:&hellip;Want better drones but not sure exactly what to build?
