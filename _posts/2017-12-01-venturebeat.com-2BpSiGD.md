excerpt: "The fear that machines will replace humans in the workplace is not a new one. In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes conjectured that in the years to come, modern economies would face a new kind of affliction: what Keynes called \"technological unemployment.\" During the Industrial Revolution -- one of the more notable examples of a radical paradigm shift in the labor market due to automation -- textile laborers were supplanted by steam-powered machinery. Today, we no longer manually assemble cars in factories. The days of human telephone switchboard operators are long gone. And by some counts, roughly half of all low-skilled positions are expected to be replaced by artificial intelligence and automation."

### How doctors and bots can (and should) work together

The fear that machines will replace humans in the workplace is not a new one. In 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes conjectured that in the years to come, modern economies would face a new kind of affliction: what Keynes called "technological unemployment." During the Industrial Revolution -- one of the more notable examples of a radical paradigm shift in the labor market due to automation -- textile laborers were supplanted by steam-powered machinery. Today, we no longer manually assemble cars in factories. The days of human telephone switchboard operators are long gone. And by some counts, roughly half of all low-skilled positions are expected to be replaced by artificial intelligence and automation.
