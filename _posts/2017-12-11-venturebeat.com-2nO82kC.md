excerpt: "Amazon today announced that Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo and Echo Plus can now be set to a specific song, playlist, podcast for alarms. Setting a music alarm is a bit like when you ask the smart speaker to play music, except you ask Alexa to \"set an alarm\" or \"wake me up,\" so now you can say \"Alexa wake me up to 'Wake me up before you go-go' at 7 am\"  or \"Alexa, wake me up to BBC News on TuneIn at 6 am.\""

### Amazon’s Alexa now has music alarms, just like your bedside radio

Amazon today announced that Alexa-enabled devices like the Echo and Echo Plus can now be set to a specific song, playlist, podcast for alarms. Setting a music alarm is a bit like when you ask the smart speaker to play music, except you ask Alexa to "set an alarm" or "wake me up," so now you can say "Alexa wake me up to 'Wake me up before you go-go' at 7 am"  or "Alexa, wake me up to BBC News on TuneIn at 6 am."
