### AI innovation will trigger the robotics network effect

Anyone who has thought about scaling a business or building a network is familiar with a dynamic referred to as the "network effect." The more buyers and sellers who use a marketplace like eBay, for example, the more useful it becomes. Well, the data network effect is a dynamic in which increased use of a service actually improves the service, such as how machine-learning models generally grow more accurate as a result of training from larger and larger volumes of data.
