### Now use Pipe mode with CSV datasets for faster training on Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms | Amazon Web Services

Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms now support Pipe mode for fetching datasets in CSV format from Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) into Amazon SageMaker while training machine learning (ML) models. With Pipe input mode, the data is streamed directly to the algorithm container while model training is in progress. This is unlike File mode, which downloads […]
