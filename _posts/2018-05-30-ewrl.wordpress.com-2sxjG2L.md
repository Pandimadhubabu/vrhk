Description
The 14th European workshop on reinforcement learning (EWRL 2018)&nbsp;invites reinforcement learning researchers to participate in&nbsp;the revival of this world-class event. We plan to make this an&nbsp;exciting event for researchers worldwide, not only for the&nbsp;presentation of top quality papers but also as a forum for&nbsp;ample discussion of open problems and future research&nbsp;directions. EWRL 2018 will consist of 3+&nbsp;tutorials (yes!), 10+ keynote talks,&nbsp;contributed paper presentations, discussion sessions spread&nbsp;over a three-day period, and a poster session.
Reinforcement learning is an active field of&nbsp;research which deals with the problem of sequential decision&nbsp;making in unknown (and often) stochastic and/or partially&nbsp;observable environments. Recently there has been a wealth of&nbsp;both impressive empirical results, as well as significant&nbsp;theoretical advances. Both types of advances are of significant&nbsp;importance and we would like to create a forum to discuss such&nbsp;interesting results.
The workshop will cover a range of sub-topics including&nbsp;(but not limited to):
Exploration/Exploitation
Function approximation in RL
Theoretical aspects of RL
Policy search methods
Empirical evaluations in RL
Kernel methods for RL
Partial observable RL
Bayesian RL
Multi-agent RL
Risk-sensitive RL
Financial RL
Knowledge Representation in RL
Neural RL
Confirmed Invited Speakers
Richard Sutton
Martin Riedmiller
Joelle Pineau
Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi
Tze Leung Lai 
Remi Munos
Andreas Krause 
Gergely Neu
More TBA !
Keynote/Tutorial
Advanced Topics in Bandit: Csaba Szepesv&aacute;ri and Tor Lattimore
Markov Games: TBA !
Paper Submission
We invite submissions for the 14th European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning (EWRL 2018) from the entire reinforcement learning spectrum. Authors can submit a 2-6 pages paper in JMLR format (excluding&nbsp;references) that will be reviewed by the program committee in a double-blind procedure. The papers can present new work or give a&nbsp;summary of recent work of the author(s). All papers will be considered&nbsp;for the poster sessions. Outstanding long papers (4-6 pages) will also be considered for a 20 minutes oral presentation.
Submission deadline: 15 June 2018, 12am CET 
Page limit:&nbsp;2-6 pages excluding references and appendix.
Paper format: JMLR format, anonymous.

Workshop Venue

EWRL14 takes place at in Lille, France. The precise address is:
&Eacute;cole Nationale Sup&eacute;rieure d&rsquo;Arts et M&eacute;tiers (Lille)
8 Boulevard Louis XIV, 59800 Lille, France
&nbsp;

Travelling to Lille
Lille is very easy to access either by road, or fast train, or plane. We sketch the simplest way to come to Lille from various places in the world. Many other ways are possible.
probably the easiest way to come to Lille from America, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and non-neighbouring countries (i.e., countries others from Belgium, the Netherlands or Germany) is to fly to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG). CDG is connected to almost all countries worldwide. Once in CDG, one catches the fast train (TGV) at the train station located in terminal 2 of CDG. 50 minutes later, you take off in one of the 2 train stations of Lille (located a few hundred meters from each other).
you may also fly to London, UK, and connect to Saint Pancras train station, board on the Eurostar (fast train between the UK and France), travel under the Channel and take off in Lille train station.
from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, it may be even easier to take a Thalys fast train straight to Lille (from Amsterdam, Brussels, or K&ouml;ln).
