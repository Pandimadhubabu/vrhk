excerpt: "Stopping poachers with machine learning:&hellip;Finally, an AI-infused surveillance &amp; response system that (most) people approve of&hellip;Researchers and staffers with the University of Southern California, Key Biodiversity Area Secretariat, World Wide Fund for Nature, Wildlife Conservation Society, and Uganda Wildlife Authority, have used machine learning to increase the effectiveness of rangers who try to stop poaching in areas of significant biodiversity. 
The project saw USC researchers collaborate with rangers in areas vulnerable to poaching in Uganda and Cambodia, and involved analyzing historical records of incidents of poaching and building predictive models to attempt to predict where poachers might strike next.&nbsp; The results are encouraging: the researchers tested their system in Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP) in Uganda and the Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS) in Cambodia, following an earlier test of the system in the Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) in Uganda. In MFNP, using the system, &ldquo;park rangers detected poaching activity in 38 cells,&rdquo; they write. Additionally, &ldquo;the amount of poaching activity observed is highest in the high-risk regions and lowest in the low-risk regions&rdquo;, suggesting that the algorithm developed by the researchers is learning useful patterns. The researchers also deployed the model in the SWS park in Cambodia and again observed that regions the algorithm classified as high risk had higher incidences of poaching.
Impact: To get a sense of the impact of this technique, we can compare the results of the field tests to typical observations made by the rangers.&nbsp; In the SWS park in Cambodia during 2018, the average number of snares confiscated each month was 101. By comparison, during the month the rangers were using the machine learning system they removed 521 snares. &ldquo;They also confiscated a firearm and they saw, but did not catch, three groups of poachers in the forest&rdquo;.
Different parks, different data: As most applied scientists know, real world data tends to contain its own surprising intricacies. Here, this manifests as radically different distributions of types of datapoints across the different parks &ndash; in the MFNP park in Uganda around 15% of the collected datapoints are for areas where poaching is thought to have occurred, compared to around 4.3% for QENP and ~0.25% for the SWS park in Cambodia. Additionally, the makeup of each dataset changes over the year as the parks change various things that factor into the data collection, like the number of rangers, or the routes they cover, and so on.
Why this matters: Machine learning approaches are giving us the ability to build a sense&amp;respond infrastructure for the world, and as we increase the sample efficiency and accuracy of such techniques we&rsquo;ll be able to better build systems to help us manage an increasingly unstable planet. It&rsquo;s deeply gratifying to see ML being used to protect biodiversity.&nbsp; Read more: Stay Ahead of Poachers: Illegal Wildlife Poaching Prediction and Patrol Planning Under Uncertainty with Field Test Evaluations (Arxiv).

Want to check-in for your flight in China? Use facial recognition:I&rsquo;ve known for some time that China has rolled out facial recognition systems in its airports to speed-up the check-in process. Now, Matthew Brennan has recorded a short video showing what this is like in practice from the perspective of a consumer. I imagine these systems will become standard worldwide within a few years.&nbsp; Note: I&rsquo;ve seen a bunch of people on Twitter saying variations of &ldquo;this technology makes me deeply uncomfortable and I hate it&rdquo;. I think I have a slightly different opinion here. If you feel strongly about this would love to better understand your position, so please tweet at me or email me!&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out the facial recognition check-in here (Matthew Brennan, Twitter).

Why language models could be smarter than you think:&hellip;LSTMs are smarter than you think, say researchers&hellip;Researchers with the Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit at the &lsquo;NeuroSpin Center&rsquo;, as well as Facebook AI Research and the University of Amsterdam, have analyzed how LSTMs keep track of certain types of information, when tested for their ability to model language structures at longer timescales. The analysis is meant to explore &ldquo;whether these generic sequence-processing devices are discovering genuine structural properties of language in their training data, or whether their success can be explained by opportunistic surface-pattern-based heuristics&rdquo;, the authors write.
The researchers study a pre-trained model &ldquo;composed of a 650-dimensional embedding layer, two 650-dimensional hidden layers, and an output layer with vocabulary size 50,000&rdquo;. They evaluate this model on a set of what they call &lsquo;number-agreement tasks&rsquo; where they test subject-verb agreement in increasingly challenging setups (eg, a simple case is looking at network activations for &lsquo;the boy greets the guy&rsquo;, with harder ones taking the form of things like &lsquo;the boy most probably greets the guy&rsquo; and &lsquo;the boy near the car kindly greets the guy&rsquo;, and so on).
Neurons that count, sometimes together: During analysis, they noticed the LSTM had developed &ldquo;two &lsquo;grandmother&rsquo; cells to carry number features from the subject to the verb across the intervening material&rdquo;. They found that these cells were sometimes used to help the network decide in particularly tricky cases: &ldquo;The LSTM also possesses a more distributed mechanism to predict number when subject and verb are close, with the grandmother number cells only playing a crucial role in more difficult long-distance cases&rdquo;.&nbsp; They also discovered a cell that &ldquo;encodes the presence of an embedded phrase separating the main subject-verb dependency, and has strong efferent connections to the long-distance number cells, suggesting that the network relies on genuine syntactic information to regulate agreement-feature percolation&rdquo;.
Why this matters: &ldquo;Strikingly, simply training an LSTM on a language-model objective on raw corpus data brought about single units carrying exceptionally specific linguistic information. Three of these units were found to form a highly interactive local network, which makes up the central part of a &lsquo;neural&rsquo; circuit performing long-distance number agreement&rdquo;, they write. &ldquo;Agreement in an LSTM language-model cannot be entirely explained away by superficial heuristics, and the networks have, to some extent, learned to build and exploit structure-based syntactic representations, akin to those conjectured to support human-sentence processing&rdquo;&nbsp; The most interesting thing about all of this is the apparent sophistication that emerges as we train these networks. It seems to inherently support some of the ideas outlined by Richard Sutton (covered in Import AI #138) about the ability for relatively simple networks to &ndash; given sufficient compute &ndash; develop very sophisticated capabilities.&nbsp; Read more: The emergence of number and syntax units in LSTM language models (Arxiv).
