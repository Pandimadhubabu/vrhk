excerpt: "Chinese scientists set new state-of-the-art in crowd counting:&hellip;The secret? Dense dilated convolutions with residual connections&hellip;Researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei have developed a new system for counting the number of people in a crowd. The system, called DSNet, sets state-of-the-art performance on four significant datasets, and should serve as a reminder that AI is an omni-use technology, where progression on fundamental techniques (eg: residual networks) can directly translate to advances in tools for surveillance.&nbsp;
Dense blocks: DSNet&rsquo;s main technical invention is what the authors call as Dense Dilated Convolutional Block. &ldquo;&rdquo;The fundamental idea of our approach is to deploy an end-to-end single-column CNN with denser scale diversity to cope with the large-scale variations and density level differences in both congested and sparse scenes&rdquo;, they write. These DDCB blocks are connected to one another across the layers of the network via residual connections, &ldquo;by doing this, the output of one DDCB has direct access to each layer of the subsequent DDCBs, resulting in a contiguous information pass&rdquo;. Subsequent ablation tests show that the residual connections have some influence over the performance of the system.&nbsp;
Testing, testing, testing: DSNet is tested against four datasets of crowds in urban places, shot in a variety of resolutions and styles: ShanghaiTechA, ShanghaiTechB, UCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50, and UCSD. DSNet system obtains significant accuracy jumps on all studied datasets.
Why this matters: I think one of the more rapid and undercovered areas of AI progress is in the field of surveillance, and papers like this show how rapidly we&rsquo;re able to take in components invented for standard supervised learning research (for instance, residual connections were invented as part of the Microsoft Research winning entry to the 2015 ImageNet competition). We should remember that advances in AI tend to improve the capabilities of surveillance systems, and should broadly seek to track these things more closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Dense Scale Network for Crowd Counting (Arxiv).&nbsp;

Tending crops with drones:&hellip;Spotting bent-over crops with drone-derived imagery&hellip;Researchers with the University of Saaskatchewan in Canada have developed a system to help them spot &lsquo;lodging&rsquo; in crops; lodging is &ldquo;when plant stems break or bend over so that plants are permanently displaced from their optimal upright position&rdquo;, they write. &ldquo;In most crops, severe lodging results in as much as a 50% yield reduction&rdquo;.A drone-gathered dataset: The researchers use a &lsquo;Draganfly&rsquo; X4P quadcopter equipped with a MicaSense RedEdge camera to gather the dataset, taking multiple photographs over a wheat field. They gather 1638 images of Canola and 465 images of Wheat in total, then stitch these into large-scale &lsquo;orthomosaic&rsquo; images of entire fields.&nbsp; LodgedNet: They train a neural net called LodgedNet against their dataset to spot &lsquo;lodging&rsquo;.

Researchers with Baidu&rsquo;s &lsquo;X-Lab&rsquo; have shown how to attack commercially available cloud services with a so-called &lsquo;Image Fusion&rsquo; (IF) attack, and have also shown that a variety of simple transformations can be applied to images to cause systems to fail to classify them. The attack model: For this attack, the researchers &ldquo;assume that the attacker can only access the APIs opened by cloud platforms, and get inner information of DL models through limited queries to generate an adversarial example&rdquo;, they write. Weaknesses to simple transforms: For simple transform attacks, the researchers explore using Gaussian Noise, Salt-and-Pepper Noise, image rotations, and monochromatization (which means they basically lop out all but one of the RGB channels on an image). They find that these attacks can cause reliable misclassifications in commercial systems from Google, Microsoft, and Clarifai.

Weaknesses to Image Fusion: Image Fusion is a fairly simple attack where the authors superimpose a background image over a primary image, creating a composite. This attack is 98%+ effective against the cloud services tested against. (The score is determined by top-1 classification, so the number of times it causes the system to suggest a single label which is wrong.
