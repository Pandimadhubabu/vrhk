excerpt: "Have you ever Googled some random question, such as how many countries are there in the world, and been impressed to see Google presenting the precise answer to you rather than just a list of links? This feature is clearly nifty and useful, but is also still limited; a search for a slightly more complex question such as how long do I need to bike to burn the calories in a Big Mac will not yield a nice answer, even though any person could look over the content of the first or second link and find the answer."

### Beyond Local Pattern Matching: Recent Advances in Machine Reading

Have you ever Googled some random question, such as how many countries are there in the world, and been impressed to see Google presenting the precise answer to you rather than just a list of links? This feature is clearly nifty and useful, but is also still limited; a search for a slightly more complex question such as how long do I need to bike to burn the calories in a Big Mac will not yield a nice answer, even though any person could look over the content of the first or second link and find the answer.
