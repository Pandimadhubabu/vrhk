excerpt: "Microsoft opens up search engine data:&hellip;New searchable archive simplifies data finding for scientists&hellip;Microsoft has released Microsoft Research Open Data, a new web portal that people can use to comb through the vast amounts of data released in recent years by Microsoft Research. The data has also been integrated with Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud services, so researchers can easily port the data over to an &lsquo;Azure Data Science virtual machine&rsquo; and start manipulating it with pre-integrated data science software.&nbsp; Data highlights: Microsoft has released some rare and potentially valuable datasets, like 10GB worth of &lsquo;Dual Word Embeddings Trained on Big Queries&lsquo; (data from live search engines tends to be very rare), along with original research-oriented datasets like FigureQA, and a bunch of specially written mad libs. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Announcing Microsoft Research Open Data &ndash; Datasets by Microsoft Research now available in the cloud (Microsoft Research Blog).Browse the data: Microsoft Research Open Data.
What does militarycivil fusion look like, and why is China so different from America?&hellip;Publication from Tsinghua VP highlights difference in technology development strategies&hellip;What happens when you have a national artificial intelligence strategy that revolves around developing military and civil AI applications together? A recent (translated) publication by You Zheng, vice president of China&rsquo;s Tsinghua University, provides some insight. &nbsp;&nbsp;Highlights: Tsinghua is currently constructing the &lsquo;High-End Laboratory for Military Intelligence&rsquo;, which will focus on developing AI to better support China&rsquo;s country-level goals. As part of this, Tsinghua will invest in basic research guided by some military requirements. The university has also created the &lsquo;Tsinghua Brain and Intelligence Laboratory&rsquo; to encourage interdisciplinary research which is less connected to direct military applications. Tsinghua also has a decade-long partnership with Chinese social network WeChat and search engine Sohuo, carrying out joint development within the civil domain. And it&rsquo;s not focusing purely on technology &ndash; the school recently created a &lsquo;Computational Legal Studies&rsquo; masters program &ldquo;to integrate the school&rsquo;s AI and liberal arts so as to try a brand-new specialty direction for the subject.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: Many governments are currently considering how to develop AI to further support their strategic goals &ndash; many countries in the West are doing this by relying on a combination of classified research, public contracts from development organizations like DARPA, and partnerships with the private sector. But the dynamics of the free market and tendency in these countries to have relatively little direct technology development and research via the state (when compared to the amounts expended by the private sector) has led to uneven development, with civil applications leaping ahead of military ones in terms of capability and impact. China&rsquo;s gamble is that a state-led development strategy can let it better take advantage of various AI capabilities to more rapidly integrate AI into its society &ndash; both civil and military. The outcome of this gamble will be a determiner of the power balance of the 21st century.&nbsp; Read more: Tsinghua&rsquo;s Approach to Military-Civil Fusion in Artificial Intelligence (Battlefield Singularity).
DeepMind bots learn to beat humans at Capture the Flag:&hellip;Another major step forward for team-based AI work&hellip;Researchers with DeepMind have trained AIs that are competitive with humans in a first-person multiplayer game. The result shows that it&rsquo;s possible to train teams of agents to collaborate with each other to achieve an objective against another team (in this case, Capture the Flag played from the first person perspective within a modified version of the game Quake 3), and follows other recent work from OpenAI on the online team-based multiplayer game Dota, as well as work by DeepMind, Facebook, and others on StarCraft 1 and StarCraft 2.&nbsp; The technique relies on a few recently developed approaches, including multi-timescale adaptation, an external memory module, and having agents evolve their own internal reward signals. DeepMind combines these techniques with a multi-agent training infrastructure which uses its recently developed &lsquo;population-based training&rsquo; technique. One of the most encouraging results is that trained agents can generalize to never-before-seen maps and typically beat humans when playing under these conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the system lets them train very strong agents: &ldquo;we probed the exploitability of the agent by allowing a team of two professional games testers with full communication to play continuously against a fixed pair of agents. Even after twelve hours of practice the human game testers were only able to win 25% (6.3% draw rate) of games against the agent team, though humans were able to beat the AIs when playing on pre-defined maps by slowly learning to exploit weaknesses in the AI. Agents were trained on ~450,000 separate games. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: This result, combined with work by others on tasks like Dota 2, shows that it&rsquo;s possible to use today&rsquo;s existing AI techniques, combined with large-scale training, to create systems capable of beating talented humans at complex tasks that require teamwork and planning over lengthy timescales &ndash; I think because of the recent pace of AI progress these results can seem weirdly unremarkable, but I think that perspective would be wrong: it is remarkable we can develop agents capable of beating people at tasks requiring &lsquo;teamwork&rsquo; &ndash; a trait that seems to require many of the cognitive tools we think are special, but which is now being shown to be achievable via relatively simple algorithms. As some have observed, one of the more intuitive yet counter-intuitive aspects of these results is how easily it seems that &lsquo;teamwork&rsquo; can be learned. &nbsp;&nbsp;Less discussed: I think we&rsquo;re entering the &lsquo;uncanny valley&rsquo; of AI research when it comes to developing things with military applications. This &lsquo;capture the flag&rsquo; demonstration, along with parallel work on OpenAI and on StarCraft, has a more militaristic flavor than prior research by the AI community. My suspicion is we&rsquo;ll need to start thinking more carefully about we contextualize results like this and work harder at analyzing which other actors may be inspired by research like this.Read more: Human-level performance in first-person multiplayer games with population-based deep reinforcement learning (Arxiv). &nbsp;&nbsp;Watch extracts of the agent&rsquo;s behavior here (YouTube).
