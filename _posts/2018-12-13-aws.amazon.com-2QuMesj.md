### Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning now supports early stopping of training jobs | Amazon Web Services

In June 2018, we launched Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning, a feature that automatically finds well-performing hyperparameters to train a machine learning model with. Unlike model parameters learned during training, hyperparameters are set before the learning process begins. A typical example of the use of hyperparameters is the learning rate of stochastic gradient procedures. Using […]
