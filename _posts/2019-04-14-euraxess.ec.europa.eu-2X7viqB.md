### Scene Understanding and Movement-based Human-Robot Collaboration in Industry 4.0

Introduction: The Centre for Robotics of MINES ParisTech, PSL Université Paris, is involved in several research projects on human motion pattern recognition applied to the Factory of the Future, the Creative and Cultural Industries and the Autonomous Vehicles. The main objective of these projects is the development of novel methodologies and technological paradigms that improve the perception of the machine and allows for natural body interactions in human-machine partnerships.
