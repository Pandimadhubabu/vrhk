excerpt: "Recent advances in neuroimaging and machine learning provide an exceptional opportunity for investigators and physicians to discover complex relationships between brain, behaviors, and mental and neurological disorders. The MLCN 2019 workshop (), as a satellite event of MICCAI 2019 (), aims to bring together researchers in both theory and application from various fields in domains such as e.g. machine learning, neuroimaging, predictive clinical neuroscience, etc. Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:
Transfer learning in clinical neuroimaging
Model stability in transfer learning
Data prerequisites for successful transfer learning
Domain adaptation in neuroimaging
Data harmonization across sites
Data pooling &ndash; practical issues
Cross-domain learning in neuroimaging
Interpretability for transfer learning
Unsupervised methods for domain adaptation
Multi-site data analysis, from preprocessing to modeling
Big data in clinical neuroimaging
Scalable machine learning methods
Benefits, problems, and solutions of working with very large datasets
Submission Process:
The workshop seeks high quality, original, and unpublished work on algorithms, theory, and applications of machine learning in clinical neuroimaging related to big data, transfer learning, and data harmonization. Papers should be submitted electronically in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LCNS) style () with up to 8-pages and using the CMT system at . The MLCN workshop uses a double-blind review process in the evaluation phase, thus authors must ensure anonymous submissions. Accepted papers will be published in a joint proceeding with the MICCAI 2019 conference.
Important Dates:
Paper submission deadline: July 1, 2019,&nbsp;July 14, 2019 (23:59 PST)
Notification of Acceptance: August 5, 2019
Camera-ready Submission: August 12, 2019
Workshop Date: October 17, 2019"
