excerpt: "Blending reality with simulation:&hellip;Gibson environment trains robots with systems and embodiment designed to better map to real world data&hellip;Researchers with Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley have created Gibson, an environment for teaching agents to learn to navigate spaces. Gibson is one of numerous navigation environments available to modern researchers and its distinguishing characteristics include: basing the environments on real spaces, and some clever rendering techniques to ensure that images seen by agents within Gibson more closely match real world images by &ldquo;embedding a mechanism to dissolve differences between Gibson&rsquo;s renderings and what a real camera would produce&rdquo;.&nbsp; Scale: &ldquo;Gibson is based on virtualizing real spaces, rather than using artificially designed ones, and currently includes over 1400 floor spaces from 572 full buildings,&rdquo; they write. The researchers also compare the total size of the Gibson dataset to other large-scale environment datasets including &lsquo;SUNCG&rsquo; and Matterport3D, showing that Gibson has reasonable navigation complexity and a lower real-world transfer error than other systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Data gathering: The researchers use a variety of different scanning devices to gather the data for Gibson, including NavVis, Matterport, and Dotproduct.&nbsp; Experiments: So how useful is Gibson? The researchers perform several experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. These include experiments around local planning and obstacle avoidance; distant visual navigation; and climbing stairs, as well as transfer learning experiments that measure the depth estimation and scene classification capabilities of the system . &nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations: Gibson has a few limitations, which include a lack of support for dynamic content (such as other moving objects) as well as no support for manipulation of the environment around itself. Future tests will involve testing if Gibson can work on finished robots as well.&nbsp; Read more: Gibson Env: Real-World Perception for Embodied Agents (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out more: Gibson official website. &nbsp;&nbsp;Gibson on GitHub.
Get ready for medieval graffiti:&hellip;4,000 images, some older than a thousand years, from an Eastern European church&hellip;Researchers with the National Technical University of Ukraine have created a dataset of images of medieval graffiti written in two alphabets (Glagolitic and Cyrillic) on the St. Sophia Cathedral of Kiev in the Ukraine, providing researchers with a dataset they can use to train and develop supervised and unsupervised classification and generation systems.&nbsp; Dataset: The researchers created a dataset of Carved Glagolitic and Crillic letters (CGCL), consisting of more than 4,000 images of 34 types of letters. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: One of the more remarkable aspects of basic supervised learning is that given sufficient data it becomes relatively easy to automate the perception of something in the world &ndash; further digitization of datasets like these increases the likelihood that in the future we&rsquo;ll use drones or robots to automatically scan ancient buildings across the world, identifying and transcribing thoughts inscribed hundreds or thousands of years ago.

Learning to create (convincing) fraudulent network traffic with Generative Adversarial Networks:&hellip;Researchers simulate traffic against a variety of (simple) intrusion detection algorithms; IDSGAN succeeds in fooling them&hellip;Researchers with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Integrated Administration Technologies for Information Security have used generative adversarial networks to create malicious network traffic than can evade the attention of some intrusion detection systems. Their technique, IDSGAN, is based on Wasserstein GAN, and trains a generator to create adversarial malicious traffics and trains a &nbsp;discriminator to assist a black-box intrusion detection system in classifying this traffic into benign or malicious categories.&nbsp; &ldquo;The goal of the model is to implement IDSGAN to generate malicious traffic examples which can deceive and evade the detection of the defense systems,&rdquo; they explain. &nbsp;&nbsp;Testing: To test their approach the researchers use NSL-KDD, a dataset containing internet traffic data as well as four categories of malicious traffic: probing, denial of service, user to root, and root to local. They also use a variety of different algorithms to play the role of the intrusion detection system, including approaches based on support vector machines, naive bayes, multi-layer perception, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor. Tests show that the IDSGAN approach leads to a significant drop in detection rates for things like DDoS drops from around 70-80% to around 3-8% across the entire suite of methods.&nbsp; Cautionary note: I&rsquo;m not convinced this is the most rigorous testing methodology you can run such a system through and I&rsquo;m curious to see how such approaches fair against commercial-off-the-shelf intrusion detection systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: Cybersecurity is going to be a natural area for significant AI development due to the vast amounts of available digital data and the already clear need for human cybersecurity professionals to be able to sift through ever larger amounts of data to create strategies resilient to external aggressors. With (very basic) approaches like this demonstrating the viability of AI to this problem it&rsquo;s likely adoption will increase.&nbsp; Read more: IDSGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Attack Generation against Intrusion Detection (Arxiv).
Facial recognition becomes a campaign issue:&hellip;Two signs AI is impacting society: police are using it, and politicians are reacting to the fact police are using it&hellip;Cynthia Nixon, currently running to be the governor of New York, has noticed recent reporting on IBM building a skin-tone-based facial recognition classification system and said that such systems wouldn&rsquo;t be supported by her, should she win. &ldquo;The racist implications of this are horrifying. As governor, I would not fund the use of discriminatory facial recognition software,&rdquo; Nixon tweeted.
Using simulators to build smarter drones for disasters:&hellip;Microsoft&rsquo;s &lsquo;AirSim&rsquo; used to train drones to patrol and (eventually) spot simulated hazardous materials&hellip;Researchers with the National University of Ireland Galway have hacked around with a drone simulator to build an environment that they can use to train drones to spot hazardous materials.
