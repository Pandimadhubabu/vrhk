### Reptile: A Scalable Meta-Learning Algorithm

We've developed a simple meta-learning algorithm called Reptile which works by repeatedly sampling a task, performing stochastic gradient descent on it, and updating the initial parameters towards the final parameters learned on that task. This method performs as well as MAML, a broadly applicable meta-learning algorithm, while being simpler to
