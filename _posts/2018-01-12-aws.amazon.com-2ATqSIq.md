excerpt: "Just as the goal of Amazon AI is to democratize machine learning with the development of platforms such as Amazon SageMaker, the goal of <http://fast.ai|fast.ai> is to level the educational playing field so that anyone can pick up machine learning and be productive. The <http://fast.ai|fast.ai> tagline is “Making neural nets uncool again.” This is not a play to decrease the popularity of deep neural networks, but instead to broaden their appeal and accessibility beyond the academic elites who have dominated the research in this area."
