excerpt: "AI investments are expected to surge 300 percent in 2017 compared to 2016, yet most of these businesses will fail to get it right. My team recently partnered with Fortune Knowledge Group to survey 300 senior executives about their AI strategies and found that only a quarter of organizations are seeing significant impact from AI. This is more than a matter of wasted IT funds -- it is an indication of a much larger issue. AI technology is a key part of business transformation, and companies that fail to get it right risk losing their competitive advantage. They are missing a huge opportunity."
