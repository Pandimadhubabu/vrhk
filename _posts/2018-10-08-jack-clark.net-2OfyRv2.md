excerpt: "UK military shows how tricky it&rsquo;ll be to apply AI to war:&hellip;Numerous AI researchers likely breathe a sigh of relief at new paper from UK&rsquo;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory&hellip;Researchers with the UK&rsquo;s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Cranfield Defense and Security Doctoral Training Centre, and IBM, have surveyed contemporary AI and thought about ways it can be integrated with the UK&rsquo;s defence establishment. The report makes for sobering reading for large military organizations keen to deploy AI, highlighting the difficulties in terms of practical deployment (eg, procurement) and in terms of capability (many military situations require AI systems that can learn and update in response to sparse, critical data.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current problems: Today&rsquo;s AI systems lack some key capabilities that militiaries need when deploying systems, like being able to configure systems to always avoid certain &ldquo;high regret&rdquo; occurrences (in the case of a military, you can imagine that firing a munition at an incorrect target (hopefully) yields such &lsquo;high regret); being resilient to adversarial examples being weaponized against systems via another actor (whether a defender or aggressor); being able to operate effectively with very small or sparse data; being able to shard AI systems across multiple partners (eg, other militaries) in such a way that the system can be reverted to sovereign control following the conclusion of an operation; and begin able to deploy such systems into the harsh low-compute operational environment that militaries face. &nbsp;&nbsp;High expectations: &ldquo;If it is to avoid the sins of its past, there is the need to manage stakeholder expectations very carefully, so that their demand signal for AI is pragmatic and achievable&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the data, stupid: Militaries, like many large government organizations, have an unfortunate tendency to sub-contract much of their IT systems out to other parties. This tends to lead to systems that are:a) moneypits
b) brittle
c) extremely hard to subsequently extend.
These factors add a confounding element to any such military deployment of AI. &ldquo;Legacy contractual decisions place what is effectively a commercial blocker to AI integration and exploitation in the Defence Equipment Program&rsquo;s near-term activity,&rdquo; the researchers write. &nbsp;&nbsp;Procurement: UK defence will also need to change the way it does procurement so it can maximize the number of small-and-medium-sized enterprises it can buy its AI systems from. But buying from SMEs creates additional complications for militaries, as working out what to do with the SME-supported service if the SME stops providing it, or goes bankrupt, is difficult and imposes a significant burden on the part of the SME.&nbsp; Why it matters: Military usage of AI is going to be large-scale, consequential, and influential in terms of geopolitics. It&rsquo;s also going to invite numerous problems from AI accidents as a consequence of poor theoretical guarantees and uneven performance properties, so it&rsquo;s encouraging to see a military organization like representatives from UK defence seek to think through this. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: A Systems Approach to Achieving the Benefits of Artificial Intelligence in UK Defence (Arxiv).
Want to understand the mind of another? Get relational!&hellip;DeepMind research into combining graph networks and relational networks shows potential for smarter, faster agents&hellip;DeepMind researchers have tried to develop smarter AI agents by combining contemporary deep learning techniques with recent work by company on graph networks and relational networks. The resulting systems rely on a new module, which DeepMind calls a &ldquo;Relational Forward Model&rdquo;. This model obtains higher performance than pure-DL baselines, suggesting that fusing DL and more structured approaches is a viable approach which yields good performance.&nbsp; How it works: The RFM module consists of a graph network encoder, a graph network decoder, and a graph-compatible GRU. Combined, these components create a way to represent structured information in a relational manner, and to update this information in response to changes in the environment (or, theoretically, the inputs of other larger structured systems). &nbsp;&nbsp;Testing: The researchers test their approach on three distinct tasks: cooperative navigation, which requires agents to collaborate to efficiently navigate to both be on a distinct reward tile in an area; coin game, which requires agents to position themselves above some reward coins and to figure out by observing eachother which coins yield a negative reward and thus should be avoided; and stag hunt, where agents inhabit a map containing stags and apples, and need to work with one another to capture stags which yield a significant reward. &ldquo;By embedding RFM modules in RL agents, they can learn to coordinate with one another faster than baseline agents, analogous to imagination-augmented agents in single-agent RL settings&rdquo; , the researchers write.&nbsp; &nbsp;The researchers compare the performance of their systems against systems using Neural Relational Inference (NRI) and Vertex Attention Interaction Networks (VAIN) and find that their approach displays significantly better performance than other approaches. They also ablated their system by training versions without the usage of relational networks, and ones using feedforward networks only. These ablations showed that both components have a significant role in the performance of these systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: The research is an extension of DeepMind&rsquo;s work on integrating graph networks with deep learning. This line of research seems promising because it provides a way to integrate structured data representations with differentiable learning systems, which might let AI researchers have their proverbial cake and eat it to by being able to marry the flexibility of learned systems with the desirable problem specification and reasoning properties of more traditional symbolic approaches. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Relational Forward Models for Multi-Agent Learning (Arxiv).
