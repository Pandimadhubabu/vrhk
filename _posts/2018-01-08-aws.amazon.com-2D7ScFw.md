### Now available in Amazon SageMaker: DeepAR algorithm for more accurate time series forecasting | Amazon Web Services

Today we are launching Amazon SageMaker DeepAR as the latest built-in algorithm for Amazon SageMaker. DeepAR is a supervised learning algorithm for time series forecasting that uses recurrent neural networks (RNN) to produce both point and probabilistic forecasts. We’re excited to give developers access to this scalable, highly accurate forecasting algorithm that drives mission-critical decisions within Amazon. Just as […]
