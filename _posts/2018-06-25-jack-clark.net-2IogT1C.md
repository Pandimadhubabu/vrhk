excerpt: "Researchers examine bias in trained language systems:&hellip;Further analysis shows further bias (what else did you expect)?&hellip;When we&rsquo;re talking about bias within language AI systems, what do we mean? Typically, we&rsquo;re describing how an AI system has developed a conceptual representation that is somehow problematic.
For instance, trained language models can frequently express different meanings when pairing a specific gender with an (ideally neutral) term like a type of work. This leads to situations where systems display coupled associations, like man:profession :: woman:homemaker.
Another example is where systems trained on biased datasets display offensive quirks, like language models trained on tabloids associating names of people of color with &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; disproportionately relative to other names.
These biases tend to emerge from the data the machine is trained on, so if you train a language model exclusively on tabloid news articles it is fairly likely the model will display the biases of that particular editorial position (a US example might be ending up associating anything related to the concept of an immigrant with negative terms).De-biasing trained models:
