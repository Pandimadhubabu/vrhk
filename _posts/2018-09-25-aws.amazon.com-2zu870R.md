### Amazon SageMaker automatic model tuning produces better models, faster | Amazon Web Services

Amazon SageMaker recently released a feature that allows you to automatically tune the hyperparameter values of your machine learning model to produce more accurate predictions. Hyperparameters are user-defined settings that dictate how an algorithm should behave during training. Examples include how large a decision tree should be grown, the number of clusters desired from a […]
