excerpt: "Paper link: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07860>
Paper looks interesting but the appropriate baselines are not current practice. These problems (mortality, readmission) have been studied in many recent DL4HC papers. There's even code for MIMIC by <https://github.com/YerevaNN/mimic3-benchmarks>."
