### Distributed Inference Using Apache MXNet and Apache Spark on Amazon EMR | Amazon Web Services

In this blog post we demonstrate how to run distributed offline inference on large datasets using Apache MXNet (incubating) and Apache Spark on Amazon EMR. We explain how offline inference is useful, why it is challenging, and how you can leverage MXNet and Spark on Amazon EMR to overcome these challenges. Distributed inference on large […]
