Want to see dinosaur skeletons, medical oddities, Civil War weapons, or Renoir masterpieces? There's a museum out there for you. But without relatability and modern storytelling, even the most captivating exhibits can be, well, a bit stuffy and boring. Especially for young people who are used to rich, complex multimedia experiences."
