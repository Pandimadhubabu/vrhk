excerpt: "Taplytics is announcing what it calls its &ldquo;Intelligent Experience Cloud,&rdquo; bringing together products for A/B testing, messaging, analytics and more
To a certain extent, this is just new branding for existing Taplytics tools, highlighting the fact that the Y Combinator-backed startup has expanded beyond mobile A/B testing by launching a full suite of products to help businesses optimize their apps.
However, co-founder and CEO Aaron Glazer said this is also the introduction of the company&rsquo;s Visual Web Experimentation Engine &mdash; basically, it takes Taplytics tools beyond mobile apps and applies them to the web.
This seems like an obvious next step, but Glazer said his team has been &ldquo;hesitant&rdquo; to tackle the web until now. For one thing, the whole rationale behind Taplytics and similar startups was that A/B testing companies focused on the web would have a hard time moving into mobile apps. Glazer said that by going in the other direction, &ldquo;We basically had to rethink the problem from the ground up.&rdquo;

The big challenge? &ldquo;There can be literally hundreds of thousands of touchpoints from a brand to their user,&rdquo; and there needs to be consistency between all those interactions.
To address this issue, Taplytics created Dexter, an AI-powered assistant that&rsquo;s supposed to offer optimization suggestions as you work, based on general best practices and the specific needs of each customer. For example, if a business is trying to improve conversion rates in its online store, Dexter will point out the changes that are most likely to yield positive results.
&ldquo;We really see Dexter as that sidekick making the user the hero,&rdquo; Glazer said.
Dexter works across Taplytics products, he added, though it will appear most prominently in the Visual Web Engine, since that&rsquo;s the newest one.
Besides launching Dexter, Glazer said his team worked to ensure that Taplytics would have &ldquo;feature parity&rdquo; with other web testing tools. And just like Taplytics on mobile, it doesn&rsquo;t require any coding to create tests or personalization."
