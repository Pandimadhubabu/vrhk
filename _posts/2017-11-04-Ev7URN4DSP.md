excerpt: "Overwatch is getting a big update that will bring Blizzard-themed content in the form of a new map and character skins. The publisher showed off its theme-park-like Blizzard World map and costumes that make Overwatch's heroes look like they are from Starcraft, Diablo, or World of Warcraft. As always, the map is free and you'll have to get the skins out of the loot boxes, but during a panel, the Overwatch team said it is putting them in the regular loot boxes instead of limited-time event crates."

### Overwatch’s Blizzard-themed skins are not part of a limited-time event

Overwatch is getting a big update that will bring Blizzard-themed content in the form of a new map and character skins. The publisher showed off its theme-park-like Blizzard World map and costumes that make Overwatch's heroes look like they are from Starcraft, Diablo, or World of Warcraft. As always, the map is free and you'll have to get the skins out of the loot boxes, but during a panel, the Overwatch team said it is putting them in the regular loot boxes instead of limited-time event crates.
