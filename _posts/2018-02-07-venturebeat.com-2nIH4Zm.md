excerpt: "More than two years after bringing its Cortana digital assistant to iPhones, Microsoft today debuted Cortana for iPad, including a new interface specifically optimized for 7.9\", 9.7\", 10.5\" and 12.9\" screens. The app also boasts 20 percent faster launch times than the prior iPhone-only version, which matters given that Cortana will likely need to be frequently re-opened on iOS devices."
