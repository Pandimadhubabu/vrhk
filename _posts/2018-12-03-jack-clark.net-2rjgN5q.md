excerpt: "#GAN_Paint: Learn to paint with an AI system:&hellip;Generating pictures out of neuron activations &ndash; a new, AI-infused photoshop filter&hellip;MIT researchers have figured out how to extract more information from trained generative adversarial networks, letting them identify specific &lsquo;neurons&rsquo; in the network that correlate to specific visual concepts. They&rsquo;ve built a website that lets anyone learn to paint with these systems. The effect is akin to having a competent ultra-fast painter standing by your shoulder, letting you broadly spraypaint an area where you&rsquo;d like, for instance, some sky, and then the software activates the relevant &lsquo;neuron&rsquo; in the GAN model and uses that to paint an image for you.&nbsp; Why it matters: Demos like this give a broader set of people a more natural way to interact with contemporary AI research, and help us develop intuitions about how the technology behaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;Paint with an AI yourself here: GANpaint (MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab website).&nbsp; Read more about the research here: GAN Dissection: Visualizing and Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks (MIT CSAIL). &nbsp;&nbsp;Paint with a GAN here (GANPaint website).
DeepMind says the future of AI safety is all about agents that learn their own reward functions:&hellip;History shows that human-specified reward functions are brittle and prone to creating agents with unsafe behaviors&hellip;Researchers with DeepMind have laid out a long-term strategy for creating AI agents that do what humans want in complex domains where it is difficult for humans to construct an appropriate reward function.&nbsp; The basic idea here is that to create safe AI agents, we want agents that figure out appropriate reward functions by collecting information from the (typically human) user and use this to learn a reward function, then we can use reinforcement learning to optimize this learned reward function. The nice thing about this approach, according to DeepMind, is that it should work for agents that have the potential to become smarter than humans: &ldquo;agents trained with reward modeling can assist the user in the evaluation process when training the next agent&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;A long-term alignment strategy: DeepMind thinks that this approach potentially has three properties that give it a chance of being adopted by researchers: it is scalable, it is economical, and it is pragmatic.&nbsp; Next steps: The researchers say these ideas are &ldquo;shovel-ready for empirical research today&rdquo;. The company believes that &ldquo;deep RL is a particularly promising technique for solving real-world problems. However, in order to unlock its potential, we need to train agents in the absence of well-specified reward functions.&rdquo; This research agenda sketches out ways to do that. &nbsp;&nbsp;Challenges: Reward modeling has a few challenges which are as follows: amount of feedback (how much data you need to collect to have the agent successfully learn the reward function); the distribution of feedback (where the agent visits new states which lead to it generating a higher perceived reward for doing actions that are in reality sub-optimal); reward hacking, which is when the agent finds a way to exploit the task to give itself reward that leads to it learning a function that does not reflect the implicit expressed wishes of the user; unacceptable outcomes (taking actions that a human would likely never approve, such as an industrial robot breaking its own hardware to achieve a task; or a personal assistant automatically writing a very rude email; and the reward-result gap (the gap between the optimal reward model and the reward function learned by the agent ). DeepMind thinks that each of these challenges can potentially be dealt with by some specific technical approaches, and today there exist several distinct ways to tackle each of the challenges, which seems to increase the chance of one working out satisfactorily.&nbsp; Why it might matter: Human empowerment: Putting aside the general utility of having AI agents that can learn to do difficult things in hard domains without inflicting harm on humans, this research agenda also implies something else: Something which isn&rsquo;t directly discussed in the paper but which is implicit to this agenda is that it offers a way to empower humans with AI. if AI systems continue to scale in capability then it seems likely that in a matter of decades we will fill society with very large AI systems which large numbers of people interact with. We can see the initial outlines of this today in the form of large-scale surveillance systems being deployed in countries like China; in self-driving car fleets being rolled out in increasing numbers in places like Phoenix, Arizona (via Google Waymo); and so on. I wonder what it might be like if we could figure out a way to maximize the number of people in society who were engaged in training AI agents via expressing preferences. After all, the central mandate of many of the world&rsquo;s political systems comes from people regularly expressing their preferences via voting (and, yes, these systems are a bit rickety and unstable at the moment, but I&rsquo;m a bit of an optimist here). Could we better align society with increasingly powerful AI systems by more deeply integrating a wider subset of society into the training and development of AI systems? &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling: a research direction (Arxiv).
