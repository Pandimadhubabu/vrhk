excerpt: "Chinese researchers use AI to build an artist-cloning mind map system:&hellip;Towards the endless, infinite AI artist&hellip;AI researchers from JD and the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing have built Mappa Mundi, software to let people construct aesthetically pleasing &lsquo;mind maps&rsquo; in the style of artist &lsquo;Qui Zhijie&rsquo;. The software was built to accompany an exhibition of Zhijie&rsquo;s work.
How it works: The system has three main elements: a speech recognition module which pulls key words from speech; a topic expansion system which takes these words and pulls in other concepts from a rule-based knowledge graph; and software for image projection which uses any of 3,000 distinct painting elements to depict key words. One clever twist: the system automatically creates visual &lsquo;routes&rsquo; between different words by analyzing their difference in the knowledge graph and using that to generate visualizations.
A reflexive, reactive system: Mappa Mundi works in-tandem with human users, growing and changing its map according to their inputs. &ldquo;The generated information, after being presented in our system, becomes the inspiration for artist&rsquo;s next vocal input,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;This artwork reflects both the development of artist&rsquo;s thinking and the AI-enabled imagination&rdquo;.
Why this matters: I&rsquo;m forever fascinated by the ways in which AI can help us better interact with the world around us, and I think systems like &lsquo;Mappa Mundi&rsquo; give us a way to interact with the idiosyncratic aesthetic space defined by another human.&nbsp; Read more: Mappa Mundi: An Interactive Artistic Mind Map Generator with Artificial Imagination (Arxiv). &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more about Qiu Zhijie (Center for Contemporary Art).

Using AI to simulate and see climate change:&hellip;CycleGAN to the rescue&hellip;In the future, climate change is likely to lead to catastrophic flooding around the world, drowning cities and farmland. How can we make this likely future feel tangible to people today? Researchers with the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, ConscienceAI Labs, and Microsoft Research, have created a system that can take in a Google Street View image of a house, then render an image showing how that house will look like under a predicted climate change future.
The resulting CycleGAN-based system does a decent job at rendering pictures of different houses under various flooding conditions, giving the viewer a more visceral sense of how climate change may influence where they live in the future.
Why this matters: I&rsquo;m excited to see how we use the utility-class artistic capabilities of modern AI tools to simulate different versions of the world for people, and I being able to easily visualize the effects of climate change may help us make more people aware of how delicate the planet is. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Visualizing the Consequences of Climate Change Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Arxiv).

Google and ARM plan to merge low-power ML software projects:&hellip;uTensor, meet TensorFlow Lite&hellip;Google and chip designer ARM are planning to merge two open source frameworks for running machine learning systems on low-power &lsquo;Arm&rsquo; chips. Specifically, uTensor is merging with Google&rsquo;s &lsquo;TensorFlow Lite&rsquo; software. The two organizations expect to work together to further increase the efficiency of running machine learning code on ARM chips.
Why this matters: As more and more people try to deploy AI to the &lsquo;edge&rsquo; (phones, tablets, drones, etc), we need new low-power chips on which to run machine learning systems. We&rsquo;ve got those chips in the form of processors from ARM and others, but we currently lack many of the programming tools needed to extract the greatest amount of performance as possible from this hardware. Software co-development agreements, like the one announced by ARM and Google, help standardize this type of software, which will likely lead to more adoption. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: uTensor and Tensor Flow Announcement (Arm Mbed blog).

Microsoft wants your devices to record (and transcribe) your meetings:&hellip;In the future, our phones and tablets will transcribe our meetings&hellip;In the future, Microsoft thinks people attending the same meeting will take out their phones and tablets, and the electronic devices will smartly coordinate to transcribe the discussions taking place. That&rsquo;s the gist of a new Microsoft research paper, which outlines a &lsquo;Virtual Microphone Array&rsquo; made of &ldquo;spatially distributed asynchronous recording devices such as laptops and mobile phones&rdquo;.
Microsoft&rsquo;s system can integrate audio from a bunch of devices spread throughout a room and use it to transcribe what is being said. The resulting system (trained on approximately 33,000 hours of in-house data) is more effective than single microphones at transcribing natural multi-speaker speech during the meeting; &ldquo;there is a clear correlation between the number of microphones and the amount of improvement over the single channel system&rdquo;, they write. The system struggles with overlapping speech, as you might expect.
Why this matters: AI gives us the ability to approximate things, and research like this shows how the smart use of AI techniques can let us approximate the capabilities of dedicated microphones, piecing one virtual microphone together out of a disparate set of devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Meeting Transcription Using Virtual Microphone Arrays (Arxiv).

One language model, trained in three different ways:&hellip;Microsoft&rsquo;s Unified pre-trained Language Model (UNILM) is a 3-objectives-in-1 transformer&hellip;Researchers with Microsoft have trained a single, big language model with three different objectives during training, yielding a system capable of a broad range of language modeling and generation tasks. They call their system the Unified pre-trained Language Model (UNILM) and say this approach has two advantages relative to single-objective training:
Training against multiple objectives means UNILM is more like a 3-in-1 system, with different capabilities that can manifest for different tasks.
Parameter sharing during joint training means the resulting language model is more robust as a consequence of being exposed to a variety of different tasks under different constraints
The model can be used for natural language understanding and generation tasks and, like BERT and GPT, is based on a &lsquo;Transformer&rsquo; component. During training, UNILM is given three distinct language modelling objectives: bidirectional (predicting words based on those on the left and right; useful for general language modeling tasks, used in BERT); unidirectional (predicting words based on those to the left; useful for language modeling and generation, used in GPT2); and sequence-to-sequence learning (mapping sequences of tokens to one another, subsequently used in &lsquo;Google Smart Reply&rsquo;).
Results: The trained UNILM system obtains state-of-the-art scores on summarization and question answering tasks, and also sets state-of-the-art on text generation tasks (including the delightful recursive tasks of learning to generate appropriate questions that map to certain answers). The model also obtains a state-of-the-art score on the multi-task &lsquo;GLUE&rsquo; benchmark (though note GLUE has subsequently been replaced by &lsquo;SuperGLUE&rsquo; due to its creators thinking it is a little too easy.
Why this matters: Language modelling is undergoing a revolution as people adopt large, simple, scalable techniques to model and generate language. Papers like UNILM gesture towards a future where large mod…"
