### Identifying bird species on the edge using the Amazon SageMaker built-in Object Detection algorithm and AWS DeepLens | Amazon Web Services

Custom object detection has become an important enabler for a wide range of industries and use cases—such as finding tumors in MRIs, identifying diseased crops, and monitoring railway platforms. In this blog post, we build a bird identifier based on an annotated public dataset. This type of model could be used in a number of […]
