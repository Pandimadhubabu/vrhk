### Progress Toward Safe and Reliable AI

Artificial intelligence and particularly machine learning have recently demonstrated tremendous achievements, and the future seems brighter still. However, these systems aren’t perfect and there is huge risk when they are deployed in applications where mistakes lead to the loss of human life or of hundreds of millions of dollars. Think of applications like commercial aircraft collision avoidance, financial transactions, or control of massive power generating or chemical manufacturing plants.
