excerpt: "In our latest paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, we use a branch of game theory to analyse asymmetric games - games where each player has different strategies, goals and rewards. Our results give us new insights into these situations and reveal a surprisingly simple way to analyse them, giving us a new tool which may be of use in economics, evolutionary biology and the analysis of environments where multiple AI systems must interact with each other."

### Game-theory insights into asymmetric multi-agent games | DeepMind

In our latest paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, we use a branch of game theory to analyse asymmetric games - games where each player has different strategies, goals and rewards. Our results give us new insights into these situations and reveal a surprisingly simple way to analyse them, giving us a new tool which may be of use in economics, evolutionary biology and the analysis of environments where multiple AI systems must interact with each other.
