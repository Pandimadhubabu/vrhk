excerpt: "Suicide is the second most common cause of death in people between the ages of 10 and 19 in Canada. Despite the country's preventative efforts, the prevalence of suicide continues to grow year over year. Existing efforts include ramped up suicide research funding, the addition of new mental wellness educational programs, and human-assisted monitoring of national suicide statistics. Though these efforts provide an important foundation for preventing suicide in Canada, it's clear additional tactics are necessary to save more lives. This is where the predictive and scalable capabilities of AI could offer assistance."
