excerpt: "TL;DR: Compressed sensing techniques enable efficient acquisition and recovery of sparse, high-dimensional data signals via low-dimensional projections. In our AISTATS 2019 paper, we introduce uncertainty autoencoders (UAE) where we treat the low-dimensional projections as noisy latent representations of an autoencoder and directly learn both the acquisition (i.e., encoding) and amortized recovery (i.e., decoding) procedures via a tractable variational information maximization objective. Empirically, we obtain on average a 32% improvement over competing methods on the task of statistical compressed sensing of high-dimensional data."

### Uncertainty Autoencoders: Learning Compressed Representations via Variational Information Maximization

TL;DR: Compressed sensing techniques enable efficient acquisition and recovery of sparse, high-dimensional data signals via low-dimensional projections. In our AISTATS 2019 paper, we introduce uncertainty autoencoders (UAE) where we treat the low-dimensional projections as noisy latent representations of an autoencoder and directly learn both the acquisition (i.e., encoding) and amortized recovery (i.e., decoding) procedures via a tractable variational information maximization objective. Empirically, we obtain on average a 32% improvement over competing methods on the task of statistical compressed sensing of high-dimensional data.
