### Transfer learning for custom labels using a TensorFlow container and “bring your own algorithm” in Amazon SageMaker | Amazon Web Services

Data scientists and developers can use the Amazon SageMaker fully managed machine learning service to build and train machine learning (ML) models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. In this blog post we’ll show you  how to use Amazon SageMaker to do transfer learning using a TensorFlow container with our own […]
