### Bring your own deep learning framework to Amazon SageMaker with Model Server for Apache MXNet | Amazon Web Services

Deep learning (DL) frameworks enable machine learning (ML) practitioners to build and train ML models. However, the process of deploying ML models in production to serve predictions (also known as inferences) in real time is more complex. It requires that ML practitioners build a scalable and performant model server, which can host these models and […]
