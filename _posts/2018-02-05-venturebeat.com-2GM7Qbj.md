excerpt: "Hate speech has existed in the United States since the founding of our country. Despite efforts to move toward becoming a more progressive, inclusive nation, it seems as though the rise of social media has made hateful keyboard warriors the poster children for modern-day America. Many social media platforms have made attempts to counter hate speech using AI-driven tactics, but the number of hateful messages spread on sites like Twitter and Facebook remains steady. There might not be a perfect solution to the problem of hate speech on social media, but third-party companies are jumping in to take a stab at creating anti-hate bots to help clean up the content on some of the most popular social platforms."

### AI could make trolls think twice before retweeting offensive content

Hate speech has existed in the United States since the founding of our country. Despite efforts to move toward becoming a more progressive, inclusive nation, it seems as though the rise of social media has made hateful keyboard warriors the poster children for modern-day America. Many social media platforms have made attempts to counter hate speech using AI-driven tactics, but the number of hateful messages spread on sites like Twitter and Facebook remains steady. There might not be a perfect solution to the problem of hate speech on social media, but third-party companies are jumping in to take a stab at creating anti-hate bots to help clean up the content on some of the most popular social platforms.
