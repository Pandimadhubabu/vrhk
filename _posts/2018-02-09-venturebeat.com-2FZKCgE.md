excerpt: "Folks who have a finger on the pulse of innovation know that the Internet of Things will likely change the way we live and work. Sensors embedded in Wi-Fi-enabled products can transmit data that helps users make decisions, detect problems, and streamline their routines. A combination of IoT and AI can form a particularly helpful technology called ambient intelligence. This smart home solution shows a lot of promise to make life a little easier for everyone, but one demographic group stands to gain notably: aging adults."

### Ambient intelligence could help make the aging process a little easier

Folks who have a finger on the pulse of innovation know that the Internet of Things will likely change the way we live and work.

A combination of IoT and AI can form a particularly helpful technology called ambient intelligence. This smart home solution shows a lot of promise to make life a little easier for everyone, but one demographic group stands to gain notably: aging adults.
