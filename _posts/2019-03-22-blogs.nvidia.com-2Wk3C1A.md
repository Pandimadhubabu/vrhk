Andras Wirth is like many early AI researchers: His deep learning ambitions only turned into reality because of a sea change in technology. A physicist, Wirth wanted to run Monte Carlo algorithms to make leaping advances in nuclear imaging, which was previously computationally impossible without massive supercomputers. A decade ago, his breakthrough came when his Read article &gt;
