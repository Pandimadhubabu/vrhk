Today we are moving towards new concepts of workplaces, and in the near future, people will work in digitally connected environments where natural human machine interaction and an agile access to data will be available. Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, Cyber Physical Systems and Internet of Things, Human-Machine Interaction, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will play central roles in the revolution that is transforming our workplaces, contributing to the creation of mixed working environments that bridge the digital and physical worlds.
