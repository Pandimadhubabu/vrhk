excerpt: "Global eye: Planet and Orbital Insight expand major satellite imagery deal:&hellip;The future of the world is a globe-spanning satellite-intelligence utility service&hellip;Imagine what it&rsquo;s like to be working in a medium-level intelligence agency in a mid-size country when you read something like this: &ldquo;Planet, who operates the largest constellation of imaging satellites, and Orbital Insight, the leader in geospatial analytics, announced today a multi-year contractor for Orbital Insight to source daily, global, satellite imagery from Planet&rdquo;. I imagine that you might think: &lsquo;wow! That looks a lot like all those deals we have to do secretly with other mid-size countries to access each other&rsquo;s imagery. And these people get to do it in the open!?&rdquo; Your next thought might be: how can I buy services from these companies to further my own intelligence capabilities?&nbsp; AI + Intelligence: The point I&rsquo;m making is that artificial intelligence is increasingly relevant to the sorts of tasks that intelligence agencies traditionally specialize in, but with the twist that lots of these intelligence-like tasks (say, automatically counting the cars in a set of parking lots across a country, or analyzing congested-versus-non-congested roads in other cities, or honing in on unusual ships in unusual waters) are now available in the private sector as well. This general diffusion of capabilities is creating many commercial and scientific benefits, but it is also narrowing the gap in capability between what people can buy versus what people can only access if they are a nuclear-capable power with a significant classified budget and access to a global internet dragnet. Much of the stability of the 20th century was derived from their being (eventually) a unipolar world in geopolitical terms with much of this stemming from inbuilt technological advantages. The ramifications of this diffusion of capability are intimately tied-up with issues relating to the &lsquo;dual-use&rsquo; nature of AI and to the changing nature of geopolitics. I hope deals like the above provoke further consideration of just how powerful &ndash; and how widely available &ndash; modern AI systems are. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Planet and Orbital Insight Expand Satellite Imagery Partnership (Cision PR Newswire).
Robots and Standards are a match made in hell, but Kindred thinks it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way:&hellip;New robot benchmarks seek to bring standardization to a tricky area of AI&hellip;Researchers with robotics startup Kindred have built on prior work on robot standardization (Import AI #87) have tried to make it easier for researchers to compare the performance of real world robots against one another by creating a suite of two tasks for each of three commercially available robot platforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;Robots used: Universal Robotics UR5 collaborative arm, Robotis MX-64AT Dynamixel actuators (which are frequently used within other robots), and a hockeypuck-shaped Create2 mobile robot.&nbsp; Standard tasks: For the UR5 arm the researchers create two reaching tasks with varying difficulty achieved by selectively turning on/off different actuators on the robot to scale complexity. For the DXL actuator they create a reacher task and also a tracking task; tracking requires that the DXL precisely track a moving target. For the Create2 robot they test it in two ways: movement, where it needs to move forward as fast as possible in a closed arena, and docking, in which the task it to dock to a charging station attached to one of the walls within the arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithmic baselines: The researchers also use their benchmarking suite to compare multiple widely used AI algorithms against eachother, including TRPO and PPO, DDPG, and Soft-Q. By using standard tasks it&rsquo;s easier for the researchers to compare the effects of things like hyperparameter choices on different algorithms, and by having these tasks take place on real world robot platforms, it&rsquo;s possible to get a sense of how well these algorithms deal with the numerous difficulties involved in reality.&nbsp; Drawbacks: One drawback of these tasks is that they&rsquo;re very simple: OpenAI recently showed how to scale PPO to let us train a robot to perform robust dextrous manipulation of a couple of simple objects, which involved having to learn to control a five-digit robot hand; by comparison, these tasks involve robot platforms with a significantly smaller number of dimensions of movement, making the tasks significantly easier. &nbsp;&nbsp;Time and robots: One meta-drawback with projects like this is that they involve learning on the robot platform, rather than learning in a mixture of simulated and real environments &ndash; this makes everything take an extraordinarily long time.

Today, some of that is occurring by connecting up AI-driven systems (for instance, product recommendation algorithms) to e-retail systems (eg Amazon), which let AI play a role in recommending courses of action to systems that ultimately go and move some mass around the world. I think for AI to become even more impactful we need to cut out the middle step and have AI move mass itself &ndash; so connecting AI to a system of sensors and actuators like a robot will eventually yield a direct-action platform for AI systems; my hypothesis is that this will dramatically increase the range of situations we can deploy learning algorithms into, and will thus hasten their development. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Benchmarking Reinforcement-Learning Algorithms on Real-World Robots (Arxiv).
