excerpt: "<http://fast.ai|fast.ai>, a research lab dedicated to making deep learning more accessible, has announced that they successfully trained the ResNet-50 deep learning model on a million images in 18 minutes using 16 Amazon EC2 P3.16xlarge instances. They accomplished this milestone by spending just $40. This new speed record illustrates how you can drastically cut down the training times for deep learning models, enabling you to bring your innovations to market faster and at a lower cost."
