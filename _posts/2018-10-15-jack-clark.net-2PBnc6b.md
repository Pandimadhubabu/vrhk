excerpt: "&lsquo;Are you the government? Want to take advantage of AI in the USA? Here&rsquo;s how!&rsquo; says thinktank:&hellip;.R-Street recommends politicians focus on talent, data, hardware, and other key areas to ensure America can benefit from advances in AI&hellip;R-Street, a Washington-based thinktank whose goal is to &ldquo;promote free markets and limited, effective government&rdquo; has written a paper recommending how the US can take advantage of AI.&nbsp; Key recommendations: R Street says that the scarce talent market for AI disproportionately benefits deep pocketed incumbents (such as Google) that can outbit other companies. &ldquo;If there were appropriate policy levers to increase the supply of skilled technical workers available in the United States, it would disproportionately benefit smaller companies and startups,&rdquo; they write.&nbsp; Talent: Boost Immigration: In particular, they highlight immigration as an area where the government may want to consider instituting changes, for instance by creating a new class of technical visa, or expanding H-1Bs.&nbsp; Talent: Offset Training Costs: Another approach could be to allow employers to detect the full costs of training staff in AI, which would further incentivize employers to increase the size of the AI workforce.&nbsp; Data: &ldquo;We can potentially create high-leverage opportunities for startups to compete against established firms if we can increase the supply of high-quality datasets available to the public,&rdquo; R Street writes. One way to do this can be to analyze data held by the government with &ldquo;a general presumption in favor of releasing government data, even if the consumer applications do not appear immediately obvious&rdquo;.&nbsp; Figure out (fair use X data X copyright): One of the problems AI is already causing is how it intersects with our existing norms and laws around intellectual property, specifically copyright law. A key question that needs to be resolved is figuring out how to assess data in terms of fair use when looking at AI systems &ndash; which will tend to consume vast amounts of data and use this data to create outputs that could, in certain legal lights, be viewed as &lsquo;derivative works&rsquo;, which would provide disincentives to people looking to develop AI.&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;Given the existing ambiguity around the issue and the large potential benefits to be reaped, further study and clarification of the legal status of training data in copyright law should be a top priority when considering new ways to boost the prospects of competition and innovation in the AI space,&rdquo; they write.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hardware: The US government should be mindful about how the international distribution of semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure could come into conflict with national strategies relating to AI and hardware.&nbsp; Why it matters: Analyses like this show how traditional policymakers are beginning to think about AI and highlights the numerous changes needed for the US to fully capitalize on its AI ecosystem. At a meta level, the broadening of discourse around AI to extend to Washington thinktanks seems like a further sign of the &lsquo;industrialization of AI&rsquo;, in the sense that the technology is now seen as having significant enough economic impacts that policymakers should start to plan and anticipate the changes it will bring.&nbsp; Read more: Reducing Entry Barriers in the Development and Application of AI (R Street).&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the PDF directly here.
Tired: Killer robots.Wired: Logistics robots for military re-supply!&hellip;UK military gives update on &lsquo;Autonomous Last Mile Resupply&rsquo; robot competition&hellip;The UK military is currently experimenting with new ways to deliver supplies to frontline troops &ndash; and it&rsquo;s looking to robots to help it out. To spur research into this area a group of UK government organizations are hosting the The Autonomous Last Mile ReSupply (ALMRS) competition.&nbsp; ALRMS is currently in phase two, in which five consortiums led by Animal Dynamics, Barnard Microsystems, Fleetonomy, Horiba Mira, and Qinetic, will build prototypes of their winning designs for testing and evaluation, receiving funding of around ~&pound;3.8million over the next few months.&nbsp; Robots are more than just drones: Some of the robots being developed for ALMRS include autonomous powered paragliders, a vertical take-off and land (VTOL) drone, autonomous hoverbikes, and various systems for autonomous logistics resupply and maintenance.&nbsp; Why it matters: Research initiatives like this will rapidly mature applications at the intersection of robotics and AI as a consequence of military organizations creating new markets for new capabilities. Many AI researchers expect that contemporary AI techniques will significantly broaden the capabilities of robotic platforms, but so far hardware development has lagged software. With schemes like ALMRS, hardware may get a boost as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: How autonomous delivery drones could revolutionise military logistics (Army Technology news website).

The challenge has two phases:&ndash; Stage 1 (grants up to $150,000 per project): &ldquo;We will seek concepts for deeply integrating ethics into existing undergraduate computer science courses&rdquo;. Winners announced April 2019.&ndash; Stage 2 (grants up to $200,000): &ldquo;We will support the spread and scale of the most promising approaches&rdquo;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Deadline: Applications will be accepted from now through to December 13 201.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why it matters: Computers are general purpose technologies, and so encouraging computer science practitioners to think about the ethical component of their work in a holistic, coupled manner, may yield to radical new designers for more positive and aware futures.&nbsp; Read more: Announcing a Competition for Ethics in Computer Science, with up to $3.5 Million in Prizes&nbsp;(Mozilla blog).
