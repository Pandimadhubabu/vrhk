excerpt: "Fast object detector YOLO gets its third major release:&hellip;Along with one of the most clearly written&nbsp;and reassuringly&nbsp;honest research papers of recent times. Seriously. Read it!&hellip;YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a fast, free object detection system developed by researchers at the University of Washington. Its latest v3 update makes it marginally faster by incorporating &ldquo;good ideas from other people&rdquo;. These include a residual network system for feature extraction which attains reasonably high scores on ImageNet classification while being more efficient than current state-of-the-art systems, and a method inspired by feature pyramid networks that improves prediction of bounding boxes.&nbsp; Reassuringly honest: The YOLOv3 paper is probably the most approachable AI research paper I&rsquo;ve read in recent years, and that&rsquo;s mostly because it doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously. Here&rsquo;s the introduction: &ldquo;Sometimes you just kinda phone it in for a year, you know? I didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot of research this year. Spent a lot of time on Twitter. Played around with GANs a little. I had a little momentum left over from last year; I managed to make some improvements to YOLO. But, honestly, nothing like super interesting, just a bunch of small changes that make it better,&rdquo; the researchers write. The paper also includes a &ldquo;Things We Tried That Didn&rsquo;t Work&rdquo; section, which should save other researchers time.&nbsp; Why it matters: YOLO makes it easy for hobbyists to access near state-of-the-art object detectors than run very quickly on tiny computational budgets, making it easier for people to deploy systems onto real world hardware, like phones or embedded chips paired with webcams. The downside of systems like YOLO is that they&rsquo;re so broadly useful that bad actors will use them as well; the researchers demonstration awareness of this via a &lsquo;What This All Means&rsquo; section: &ldquo;&ldquo;What are we going to do with these detectors now that we have them?&rdquo; A lot of the people doing this research are at Google and Facebook. I guess at least we know the technology is in good hands and definitely won&rsquo;t be used to harvest your personal information and sell it to&hellip;. wait, you&rsquo;re saying that&rsquo;s exactly what it will be used for?? Oh. Well the other people heavily funding vision research are the military and they&rsquo;ve never done anything horrible like killing lots of people with new technology oh wait&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement (PDF).&nbsp;&nbsp;More information on the official YOLO website here.
The military AI cometh: new reference architecture for MilSpec defense detailed by researchers:&hellip;NATO researchers plot automated, AI-based cyber defense systems&hellip;A NATO research group, led by the US Army Research Laboratory, has published a paper on a reference architecture for a cyber defense agent that uses AI to enhance its capabilities. The paper is worth reading because it provides a nuts&amp;bolts perspective on how a lot of militaries around the world are viewing AI: AI systems let you automate more stuff, automation lets you increase the speed with which you can take actions and thereby gain strategic initiative against an opponent, so the goal of most technology integrations is to automate as many chunks of a process as possible to retain speed of response and therefore initiative.&nbsp; &ldquo;Artificial cyber hunters&ldquo;: &ldquo;In a conflict with a technically sophisticated adversary, NATO military tactical networks will operate in a heavily contested battlefield. Enemy software cyber agents&mdash;malware&mdash;will infiltrate friendly networks and attack friendly command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) and computerized weapon systems. To fight them, NATO needs artificial cyber hunters&mdash;intelligent, autonomous, mobile agents specialized in active cyber defense,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp;&nbsp;How the agents work: The researchers propose agents that possess five main components: &ldquo;sensing and world state identification&rdquo;, &ldquo;planning and action selection&rdquo;, &ldquo;collaboration and negotiation&rdquo;, &ldquo;action execution&rdquo;, and &ldquo;learning and knowledge improvement&rdquo;. Each of these functions has a bunch of sub-systems to perform tasks like ingest data from the agent&rsquo;s actions, ot to communicate and collaborate with other agents.&nbsp; Usage scenarios: These agents are designed to be modular and deployable across a variety of different form factors and usage scenarios, including multiple agents that deployed throughout a vehicle&rsquo;s weapons, navigation, and observation systems, as well as the laptops used by its human crew, and managed by a single &ldquo;master agent&rdquo;. Under this scenario, the NATO researchers detail a threat where the vehicle is compromized by a virus placed into it during maintenance; this virus is subsequently detected by one of the agents when it begins scanning other subsystems within the vehicle, causing the agents deployed on the vehicle to decrease trust in the &lsquo;vehicle management system&rsquo; and places the BMS (an in-vehicle system used to survey the surrounding territory) into an alert state. Next, one of the surveillance AI agents discovers that the enemy malware has loaded software directly into the BMS, causing the AI agent to automatically restart the BMS to reset it to a safe state.&nbsp; Why it matters: As systems like these move from reference architectures to functional blocks of code we&rsquo;re going to see the nature of conflict change as systems become more reactive over shorter timescales, which will further condition the sorts of strategies people use in conflict. Luckily, technologies for offense are too crude and brittle and unpredictable to be explored by militiaries any time soon, so most of this work will take place in the area of defense, for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Initial Reference Architecture of an Intelligent Autonomous Agent for Cyber Defense (Arxiv).
Google researchers train agents to project themselves forward and to work backward from the goal:&hellip;Agents perform better at long horizon tasks when they&hellip;When I try to solve a task I tend to do two things: I think of the steps I reckon I need to take to be able to complete it, and then I think of the end state and try to work my way backwards from there to where I am. Today, most AI agents just do the first thing, exploring (usually without a well-defined notion of the end state) until they stumble into correct behaviors. Now, researchers with Google Brain have proposed a somewhat limited approach to give agents the ability to work backwards as well.

The agent is able to then use this information to project forward from its own state when considering the next actions, and also look backward from its sense of the goal to help it perform better action selection.
