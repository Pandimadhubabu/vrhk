excerpt: "Want to break an image classifier? Add some weather:&hellip;Don&rsquo;t use AI on a snow day&hellip;Many of today&rsquo;s object recognition systems are less robust and repeatable than people might assume &ndash; new research from the University of Tubingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems shows just how fragile these systems are, with a trio of datasets that help people test the resilience of their AI systems.&nbsp;
Three datasets to frustrate AI systems: The three datasets are called Pascal-C, Coco-C, and Cityscapes-C; these are &lsquo;corrupted&rsquo; versions of existing datasets, and for each dataset the images within are corrupted with any of 15 distortions, each with five levels of severity. Some of the distortions that can be applied to the images include the addition of snow, frost, or fog to an image, as well as other distortions like the addition of noise, or the use of certain types of transforms.&nbsp;
Just how bad is it: Out-of-the-box algorithms (typically based on the widely-used R-CNN family of models) see relative performance drops of between 30 and 50% on the corrupted versions of the datasts, highlighting the brittleness of many of today&rsquo;s algorithms.&nbsp;
Saving algorithms with messy data: One simple trick people can use to improve the robustness of models is to train them on stylized data &ndash; here, they basically take the underlying dataset and for each image create a variant stylized with a texture. These images are combined with the clean data, then trained on; models trained against datasets that incorporate the stylized data are more robust than those trained purely on clean data &ndash; this makes sense, as we&rsquo;ve basically algorithmically expanded the dataset to encourage a certain type of generalization.&nbsp;
Why this matters: Datasets like this make it easier for people to investigate the robustness of trained AI models, which can help us understand how contemporary models may fail and provide data to calibrate against when designing more robust ones. And the authors hope that other researchers will expand the benchmark further:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We encourage readers to expand the benchmark with novel corruption types. In order to achieve robust models, testing against a wide variety of different image corruptions is necessary, there is no &lsquo;too much&rsquo;. Since our benchmark is open source, we welcome new corruption types and look forward to your pull requests to  more: Benchmarking Robustness in Object Detection: Autonomous Driving when Winter is Coming (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the code, data, and benchmarking leaderboard here (&lsquo;Robust Detection Benchmark&rsquo; official GitHub).&nbsp;

The future of AI is&hellip; *checks notes* an AI assistant for the procedural building game Minecraft:&hellip;Facebooks &lsquo;CraftAssist&rsquo; project tries to build smarter AI systems by having them work alongside humans&hellip;Facebook AI Research wants to study increasingly advanced AI systems by studying humans work alongside smart computers, so it has developed a bot to assist human players in the procedural building game Minecraft. &ldquo;The ultimate goal of the bot is to be a useful and fun assistant in a wide variety of tasks specified and evaluated by human players&rdquo;, they write.&nbsp;
How the bot works: The robot works by taking in written prompts in natural language, then maps those to sequences of actions, like moving around the world or interacting with objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in response to the query &ldquo;go to the blue house&rdquo;, the agent would try and map &lsquo;blue&rsquo; and &lsquo;house&rsquo; to entities it had stored in its memory, and if it found them would try to create a &lsquo;move&rsquo; task that could let the agent navigate to that part of the world. The team achieves this via a neural semantic parser they call the Text-to-Action-Dictionary (TTAD) model, which converts natural language commands to specific actions. The agent also ships with systems to help out process the world around it, crudely analyzing the terrain and also heuristics for referring to objects based on their positions.&nbsp;
Future extensions: Facebook has designed its agent to be extended in the future with more advanced AI capabilities. To that end, any CraftAssist agent can take in images in the form of a 64X64 &lsquo;block&rsquo; resolution view (so viewing in terms of blocks in minecraft, rather than individual pixels). The agents can also access a 3D map of the space they&rsquo;re in, so can locate any block within the world around them.&nbsp;
Datasets: Facebook is releasing a dataset consisting of 800000 pairs of (algorithmically generated) actions and written instructions, 25402 human-written sentences that map to some of these actions pairs; 2513 suggested/imagined commands from humans that interacted with the bot, and 708 dialogue-action pairs from in-game chat. They&rsquo;ve also release a &lsquo;House&rsquo; dataset, which consists of 2050 human-built houses from Minecraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why this matters: Embedding AI systems into games will likely be one of the ways that we see people take AI research and port it into production &ndash; the use of Minecraft here is interesting given its playerbase numbering in the tens of millions, many of them children. Could we eventually see AI systems trained via the conversations with kids talking in broken English, training more robust policies through childish lingo? I think so! Next up: a generative Fortnite dance machine!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: CraftAssist: A Framework for Dialogue-enabled Interactive Agents (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the code for CraftAssist here (official GitHub repository).

Counting cars with deep learning and satellite imagery:How can you count cars in countries that don&rsquo;t have sensors wired into roads and traffic lights to gather the required data? Researchers with CMU and ETH Zurich think the use of deep learning and satellite imagery could be a viable supplement, and could help countries easily get measures for the Average Annual Daily Truck Traffic (AADTT) in a given region.&nbsp;
In new research, they develop &ldquo;a remote sensing approach to monitor freight vehicles through the use of high-resolution satellite images,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;As satellite images become both cheaper and are taken at a higher resolution over time, we anticipate that our approach will become scalable at an affordable cost within the next few years to much larger geographic regions&rdquo;.
The data: To train their system, the researchers hand-annotated vehicles seen in satellite images with around 2,000 bounding boxes from the Northeastern USA. &ldquo;We used the predicted vehicle count from the detection model, the time stamp of the images, time-varying factors, and speed to make a probabilistic prediction of the AADTT&rdquo;.
Testing generalization: The researchers gathered the data in America, and tested it also on data gathered from Brazil to explore the generalization properties of their system. &ldquo;We found that distinct truck types (rather than geography) can impact the prediction accuracy of the detection model, and additional training seems necessary to transfer the model between countries,&rdquo; they write. Additionally, &ldquo;information on local driving patterns and labor laws could reduce the estimation error from the traffic monitoring model.&rdquo; They trained a single-shot detection model to detect vehicles, and found that the model could provide reasonable predictions for locations from the United States, but struggled to provide as accurate predictions for Brazil, even once finetuned.&nbsp;
