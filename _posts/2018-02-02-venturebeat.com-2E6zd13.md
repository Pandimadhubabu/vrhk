excerpt: "The illusion of job safety for the 3.5 million cashiers in America was shattered last week when Amazon Go, the first cashierless grocery store in the United States, opened in Seattle. By most accounts, the store is highly functional: It is difficult to shoplift, and the technology -- which Amazon described only as involving \"sophisticated computer vision and machine learning software\" -- accurately identifies which items shoppers put in their bags. In contrast to previous efforts at automating grocery store checkout, like the perpetually frustrating self-checkout kiosks, this one looks like it just might be a success."

The illusion of job safety for the 3.5 million cashiers in America was shattered last week when Amazon Go, the first cashierless grocery store in the United States, opened in Seattle.

In contrast to previous efforts at automating grocery store checkout, like the perpetually frustrating self-checkout kiosks, this one looks like it just might be a success.
