### Google AI generates images of 3D models with realistic lighting and reflections

Artificial intelligence (AI) that can synthesize realistic three-dimensional object models isn’t as far-fetched as it might seem. In a paper (“Visual Object Networks: Image Generation with Disentangled 3D Representation“) accepted at the NeurIPS 2018 conference in Montreal, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT CSAL) and Google describe a …
