excerpt: "In my previous post on the new Python Bounter library we discussed how we can use its HashTable to quickly count approximate item frequencies in very large sets. Now we turn our attention to the second algorithm in Bounter, CountMinSketch (CMS), which is also optimized in C for top performance."

### Counting Efficiently with Bounter pt. 2: CountMinSketch | RaRe Technologies

In my previous post on the new Python Bounter library we discussed how we can use its HashTable to quickly count approximate item frequencies in very large sets. Now we turn our attention to the second algorithm in Bounter, CountMinSketch (CMS), which is also optimized in C for top performance.
