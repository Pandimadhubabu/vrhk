excerpt: "US hospital trials delivering medical equipment via drone:&hellip;Pilot between WakeMed, Matternet, and NC Department of Transportation&hellip;A US healthcare organization, WakeMed Health &amp; Hospitals, is conducting experiments at transporting medical deliveries around its sprawling healthcare campus (which includes a hospital). The project is a partnership between WakeMed and drone delivery company Matternet. The flights are being conducted as part of the federal government&rsquo;s UAS Integration Pilot Program.&nbsp; Why it matters: Drones are going to make entirely new types of logistics and supply chain infrastructures possible. As happened with the mobile phone, emerging countries across Africa and developing economies like China and India are adopting drone technology faster than traditional developed economies. With pilots like thes, there is some indication that might change, potentially bringing benefits of the technology to us citizens more rapidly. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Medical Drone Deliveries Tested at North Carolina Hospital (Unmanned Aerial).
Does your robot keep crashing into walls? Does it have trouble navigating between rooms? Then consider training it on NavigationNet:&hellip;Training future systems to navigate the world via datasets with implicit and explicit structure and topology&hellip;NavigationNet consists of hundreds of thousands of images distributed across 15 distinct scenes &ndash; collections of images from the same indoor space. Each scene contains approximately one to three rooms (spaces separated from eachother by doors), and each room has at least 50m^2 in area; each room contains thousands of positions, which are views of the room separated by approximately 20cm. In essence, this makes NavigationNet a large, navigable dataset, where the images within it comprise a very particular set of spatial relationships and hierarchies.&nbsp; Navigation within NavigationNet: Agents tested on the corpus can perform the following movement actions: move forward, backward, left, right; and turn left and turn right. Note that this ignores the third dimension. &nbsp;&nbsp;Dataset collection: To gather the data within NavigationNet the team built a data-collection mobile robot codenamed &lsquo;GoodCar&rsquo; equipped with an Arduino Mega2560 and a Raspberry Pi 3. They stuck the robot on a motorized base and stuck eight cameras at a height of around 1.4 meters to capture the images.&nbsp; &nbsp;Testing: The researchers imagine that this sort of data can be used to develop the brains of AI agents trained via deep reinforcement learning to navigate unfamiliar spaces for purposes like traversing rooms, automatically mapping rooms, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;The push for connected spaces: NavigationNet isn&rsquo;t unusual, instead it&rsquo;s part of a new trend for dataset creation for navigation tasks: researchers are now seeking to gather real (and sometimes simulated) data which can be stitched together into a specific topological set of relationships, then they are using these datasets to train agents with reinforcement learning to navigate the spaces described by their contents. Eventually the thinking goes, datasets like this will give us the tools we need to develop some bits of the visual-processing and planning capabilities demanded by future robots and drones. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: Data has been one of the main inputs to innovation in the domain of supervised learning (and increasingly in reinforcement learning). Systems like NavigationNet give researchers access to potentially useful sources of data for training real world systems. However, it&rsquo;s unclear right now if simulated data can be as good a substitute given the increasing maturity of sim2real transfer techniques &ndash; I look forward to seeing benchmarks of systems trained in NavigationNet against systems trained via other datasets. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: NavigationNet: A Large-scale Interactive Indoor Navigation Dataset (Arxiv).
Google rewards its developers with &lsquo;Dopamine&rsquo; RL development system:&hellip;Free RL framework designed to speed up research; ships with DQN, C51, Rainbow, and IQN implementations&hellip;Google has released Dopamine, a research framework for the rapid prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms. The software is designed to make it easy for people to run experiments, try out research ideas, compare and contract existing algorithms, and increase the reproducability of results.&nbsp; Free algorithms: Dopamine today ships with implementations of the DQN, C51, Rainbow, and IQN algorithms. &nbsp;&nbsp;Warning: Frameworks like this tend to appear and disappear according to the ever-shifting habits and affiliations of the people that have committed code into the project. In that light, the note in the readme that &ldquo;this is not an official Google product&rdquo; may inspire some caution. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Dopamine (Google Github).

Gill has the unenviable job of playing referee in a debate whose stakeholders range from countries, to major private sector entities, to NGOs, and so on.&nbsp; AI and Dual-Use: In the interview Gill is asked about his opinion of the challenge of regulating AI given the speed with which the technology has proliferated and the fact most of the dangerous capabilities are embodied in software. &ldquo;AI is perhaps not so different from these earlier examples. What is perhaps different is the speed and scale of change, and the difficulty in understanding the direction of deployment.
