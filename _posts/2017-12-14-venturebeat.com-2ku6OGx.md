excerpt: "Intellect is the faculty of reasoning and objective understanding. Intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge and skills. Both of these definitions were yielded to me by my laptop, a general purpose machine, which is itself an ancestor of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC). The ENIAC was the first programmable machine, built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Up to that point, all tools were single-purpose -- that is, designed to do one thing. Hammers, calculators, steam engines, and bow and arrows are all examples of single-use tools. The rise of computers made it so we can now set our tools to adapt themselves."

### Intellect vs. intelligence: The difference matters in AI

Intellect is the faculty of reasoning and objective understanding. Intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge and skills. Both of these definitions were yielded to me by my laptop, a general purpose machine, which is itself an ancestor of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC). The ENIAC was the first programmable machine, built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Up to that point, all tools were single-purpose -- that is, designed to do one thing. Hammers, calculators, steam engines, and bow and arrows are all examples of single-use tools. The rise of computers made it so we can now set our tools to adapt themselves.
