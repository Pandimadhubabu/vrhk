### A Discussion of 'Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features': Learning from Incorrectly Labeled Data

Section 3.2 of Ilyas et al. (2019) shows that training a model on only adversarial errors leads to non-trivial generalization on the original test set. We show that these experiments are a specific case of learning from errors.
