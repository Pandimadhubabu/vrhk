### Bring your own hyperparameter optimization algorithm on Amazon SageMaker | Amazon Web Services

In this blog post, we’ll discuss how to implement custom, state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms to tune models on Amazon SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker includes a built-in HPO algorithm, but provides the flexibility to use your own HPO algorithm. We’ll provide you with a framework to incorporate an HPO algorithm that you choose. However, before we […]
