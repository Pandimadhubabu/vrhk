### The importance of hyperparameter tuning for scaling deep learning training to multiple GPUs | Amazon Web Services

Parallel processing with multiple GPUs is an important step in scaling training of deep models. In each training iteration, typically a small subset of the dataset, called a mini-batch, is processed. When a single GPU is available, processing of the mini-batch in each training iteration is handled by this GPU. When training with multiple GPUs, […]
