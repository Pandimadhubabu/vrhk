excerpt: "spaCy v2.0's Named Entity Recognition system features a sophisticated word embedding strategy using subword features and "Bloom" embeddings, a deep convolutional neural network with residual connections, and a novel transition-based approach to named entity parsing. The system is designed to give a good balance of efficiency, accuracy and adaptability. In this talk, I sketch out the components of the system, explaining the intuition behind the various choices. I also give a brief introduction to the named entity recognition problem, with an overview of what else Explosion AI is working on, and why."

### SPACY'S ENTITY RECOGNITION MODEL: incremental parsing with Bloom embeddings &amp; residual CNNs

spaCy v2.0's Named Entity Recognition system features a sophisticated word embedding strategy using subword features and "Bloom" embeddings, a deep convolutional neural network with residual connections, and a novel transition-based approach to named entity parsing. The system is designed to give a good balance of efficiency, accuracy and adaptability. In this talk, I sketch out the components of the system, explaining the intuition behind the various choices. I also give a brief introduction to the named entity recognition problem, with an overview of what else Explosion AI is working on, and why.
