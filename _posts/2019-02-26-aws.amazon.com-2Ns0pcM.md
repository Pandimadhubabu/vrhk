### Preprocess input data before making predictions using Amazon SageMaker inference pipelines and Scikit-learn | Amazon Web Services

Amazon SageMaker enables developers and data scientists to build, train, tune, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at scale. You can deploy trained ML models for real-time or batch predictions on unseen data, a process known as inference. However, in most cases, the raw input data must be preprocessed and can’t be used directly for […]
