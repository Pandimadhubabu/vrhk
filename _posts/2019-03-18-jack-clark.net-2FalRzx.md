excerpt: "Why the unreasonable effectiveness of compute is a &ldquo;bitter lesson&rdquo; for AI research:&hellip;Richard Sutton explains that &ldquo;general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective&rdquo;&hellip;Richard Sutton, one of the godfathers of reinforcement learning*, has written about the relationship between compute and and AI progress, noting that the use of larger and larger amounts of computation paired with relatively simple algorithms has typically led to the emergence of more varied and independent AI capabilities than many human-designed algorithms or approaches. &ldquo;The only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation&rdquo;, Sutton writes.
Many examples, one rule: Some of the domains where computers have beaten methods based on human knowledge include Chess, Go, speech recognition, and many examples in computer vision.
The bitter lesson: &ldquo;We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run,&rdquo; Sutton says. &ldquo;The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning.&rdquo;
Why this matters: If compute is the main thing that unlocks new AI capabilities, then we can expect most of the strategic (and related geopolitical) landscape of AI research to re-configure in coming years around a compute-centric model, which will likely have significant implications for the AI community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: The Bitter Lesson (Rich Sutton).&nbsp; * Richard Sutton literally (co)wrote the book on reinforcement learning.

AI + Comedy, with Naomi Saphra!&hellip;Comedy set lampoons funding model in AI, capitalism, NLP&hellip;Naomi Saphra, an NLP researcher, has put a video online of her doing stand-up AI comedy at a venue in Edinburgh, Scotland. Check out the video for her observations on working in AI research, funding AI research, tales about Nazi rocket researchers, and more. 
&nbsp; &ldquo;You always have to ask yourself, who else finds this interesting? If you mean who reads my papers and cites my papers? The answer is nobody. If you mean who has given me money? The answer is mostly evil&hellip; you see I have the same problem as anyone in this world &ndash; I hate capitalism but I love money&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watch her comedy set here: Naomi Saphra, Paying the Panopticon (YouTube).

Prototype experiment shows why robots might tag-team in the future:&hellip;Use of a tether means 1+1 is greater than 2 here&hellip;Researchers with the University of Tokyo, Japan, have created a two-robot team that can map its surroundings and traverse vertiginous terrain via the use of a tether, which lets an airborne drone vehicle assist a ground vehicle.
The drone uses an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 chip to perform onboard localization, mapping and navigation. The drone is equipped with a camera, time-of-flight sensor, and a laser sensor for height measurement. The ground vehicle is &ldquo;based on a commercially available caterpillar platform&rdquo; using a UP Core processing unit. The ground robot is running a copy of the robot operating system, which the airborne drone uses to connect to it. 
Smart robots climb with a dumb tether: The robots work together like this: the UAV flies above the UGV and maps the terrain, feeding data down to the ground robot, giving it awareness of its surroundings. When the robots detect an obstruction, the UAV wraps the tether (which has a grappling hook on its end) around a tall object, and the UGV uses the secured tether to climb the object. 
Real world testing: The researchers test their system in a small-scale real world experiment and find that the approach works, but has some problems: &ldquo;Since we did not have a [tether] tension control mechanism due to the lack of sensor, the tether needed to be extended from the start and as the result, the UGV suffered from the entangled tether many times.&rdquo;
Why this matters: In the future, we can imagine various robots of different types collaborating with eachother, using specialisms to operate as a unit, becoming more than the sum of their parts. Though as this experiment indicates we&rsquo;re still at a relatively early stage of development here, and several kinks need to be worked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: UAV/UGV Autonomous Cooperation: UAV assists UGV to climb a cliff by attaching a tether (Arxiv).

Facebook tries to build a standard container for AI chips:&hellip;New Open Compute Project (OCP) design supports both 12v and 48v inputs&hellip;These days, many AI organizations are contemplating building data centers consisting of lots of different types of servers running many different chips, ranging from CPUs to GPUs to custom accelerator chips designed for AI workloads. Facebook wants to standardize the types of chassis used to house AI-accelerator chips, and has contributed an open source hardware schematic and specification to the Open Compute Project &ndash; a Facebook-born scheme to standardize the sorts of server equipment used by so-called hyperscale data center operators.
The proposed OCP accelerator module supports 12V and 48V inputs and can support up to 350W (12V) or up to 700W (48V) TDP (Thermal Design Power) for the chips in the module &ndash; a useful trait, given that many new accelerator chips guzzle significant amounts of power (though you&rsquo;ll need to use liquid cooling for any servers consuming above 450W TDP). It can support single or multiple ASICs within each chassis, with support for up to eight accelerators per system.
Check out the design yourself: You can read about the proposed OCP Accelerator Module (OAM) in more detail here at the Open Compute Project (OCP) site.
Why this matters: As AI goes through its industrialization phase, we can expect people to invest more in the fundamental infrastructure which AI equipment requires. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see the extent to which there is demand for a standardized AI accelerator module, and symptoms for such demand will likely come from low-cost Asian-based original design manufacturers (ODMs) producing standardized chasses that use this design.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Sharing a common form factor for accelerator modules (Facebook Code).
