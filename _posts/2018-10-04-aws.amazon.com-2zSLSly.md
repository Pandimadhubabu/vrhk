### Segmenting brain tissue using Apache MXNet with Amazon SageMaker and AWS Greengrass ML Inference – Part 2 | Amazon Web Services

In Part 1 of this blog post, we demonstrated how to train and deploy neural networks to automatically segment brain tissue from an MRI scan in a simple, streamlined way using Amazon SageMaker. We used Apache MXNet to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on Amazon SageMaker using the Bring Your Own Script paradigm. We […]
