excerpt: "Voice is becoming a primary interface. It's in many of the technologies we use on a daily basis, like our home appliances, cars, and mobile apps.

This is made possible by smart speakers such as Amazon Echo, Alexa, and Google Home."

This is made possible by smart speakers such as Amazon Echo, Alexa, and Google Home.
