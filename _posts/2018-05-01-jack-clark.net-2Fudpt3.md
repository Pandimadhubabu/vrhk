excerpt: "Good facial recognition performance on a tiny parameter budget:&hellip;Chinese researchers further compress specialized facial recognition networks&hellip;Chinese researchers have published details on a type of lightweight facial recognition network which they call a MobileFaceNet. Their network obtains accuracy of up to 99.28% accuracy on the labelled faces in the wild (LFW) dataset, and 93.05% accuracy on recognizing faces in the AgeDB dataset while using around a million parameters taking 24ms to execute on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU. This compares to accuracies of 98.70% and 89.27% for ShuffleNet, which also has more parameters and takes marginally longer to execute on the CPU.&nbsp;One tweak the MobileFaceNet creators make is to replace the global average pooling layer in the CNN with a global depthwise convolution layer, which improves performance on facial recognition.&nbsp; Why it matters:&nbsp;As developers refine models to maximize performance on smaller compute envelopes it will become easier to deploy more AI-based classification systems more widely into the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: MobileFaceNets: Efficient CNNs for Accurate Real-time Face Verification on Mobile Devices (Arxiv).
UK House of Lords recommends a national AI strategy:&hellip;Recommendations include: measurement and assessment of AI, categorizing healthcare data as a national asset, and working with other countries on developing norms and ethics for AI&hellip;The United Kingdom&rsquo;s House of Lords Select Committee has released its report on the UK&rsquo;s AI strategy. The almost two-hundred page report, AI in the UK: ready, willing and able? covers issues ranging from how to design AI, how to develop it, how to work with it, and how to engage with it.&nbsp; Main recommendations: The report makes a few robust and specific recommendations, including: the government should underwrite and where necessary replace funding for European research and innovation programmes after the UK decouples from the European Union via Brexit; government should continue to support a variety of different long-term AI research initiatives to hedge against deep learning progress plateauing; public procurement regulations should be amended to make it easier for small- and medium-sized AI companies to sell to the government; government should create its own AI challenges and competitions and highlight these via a public bulletin board to catalyze development; government should proactively analysis and assess the evolution of AI in the UK to help it prepare for disruptions to the labor market; the UK&rsquo;s vast amount of medical data which is centralized within the National Health Service &ldquo;could be considered a unique source of value for the nation&rdquo;; government should explore whether existing legislation addresses the legal liability issues of AI to prepare for increasingly autonomous systems; the UK government should convene a &ldquo;global summit&rdquo; in London by the end of 2019 to begin development of a common framework for the ethical development and deployment of AI, and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;An AI code: The report also suggests developing a specific set of principles with which the UK&rsquo;s AI community should approach AI. These principles are:&ndash; Artificial intelligence should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity.
&ndash; Artificial intelligence should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness.
&ndash; Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or communities.
&ndash; All citizens should have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally, emotionally and economically alongside artificial intelligence.
&ndash; The autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive human beings should never be vested in artificial intelligence.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read more: UK can lead the way on ethical AI, says Lords Committee (summary).&nbsp; &nbsp;Read more: Full report: AI in the UK: ready, willing and able?

Speculative benchmarks for deep learning: SQUISHY FACES:&hellip;MIT study shows how good people are at recognizing distorted&nbsp;facial features:A new MIT study shows that people can recognize faces even when they&rsquo;ve been dramatically compressed vertically or horizontally, suggesting our internal object recognition systems are very robust. In the study, the researchers discover we do well when things are uniformly squashed, but struggle if different parts are scaled out of relation to eachother, like re-scaling the eyes and nose and mouth but keeping the main face at the same size. I wonder whether we could eventually test the robustness of classifiers by evaluating them on test-sets that contained such distortions? &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: We&rsquo;re Good At Recognizing Distorted Faces (Discover Magazine).
New DAWNBench results highlight power of new processor architectures:&hellip;TPUs rule everything around me&hellip;New results from the Stanford-led AI benchmarking project DAWNBench show how custom chips may let AI researchers cut the time and cost it takes them to do experiments. New results from Google show that systems that use a 32 &ldquo;Tensor Processing Unit&rdquo; chips can train ImageNet to 93% accuracy in as little as 30 minutes. TPUs may also be cheaper than other chips, with Google showing it can train ImageNet to 93% accuracy via TPUs at a cost of $49.30 worth of cloud compute. &nbsp;&nbsp;Encouraging: The leaderboard isn&rsquo;t just about giant tech companies: kudos to  which has taken third place in training cost ($72.53 for 93% ImageNet running on eight NVIDIA V100 GPUs) and training time (fourth place, 2:57:49, same system as above.) &nbsp;&nbsp;Check out more of the DAWNBench results here.
AI luminaries call for the creation of a European AI megalab:&hellip;ELLIS lab to battle brain drain via large salaries, significant autonomy, and multi-country and multi-lab investments&hellip;Prominent AI researchers from across Europe and the rest of the world have signed an open letter calling for the foundation of the &ldquo;European Lab for Learning &amp; Intelligence Systems&rdquo; (acronym: ELLIS). The lab is designed to benefit Europe in two ways:&ndash; Enable &ldquo;the best basic research&rdquo; to occur in Europe, allowing the region to further shape how AI influences the world.
&ndash; Achieve major economic impact via AI. The signatories &ldquo;believe this is achieved by outstanding and free basic research, independent of industry interests.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Europe lags: The scientists worry that Europe is failing to maintain competitiveness with China and North America when it comes to AI and something like ELLIS needs to be built to allow the region to maintain competitiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp;A recipe for success: The ELLIS lab should have &ldquo;outstanding facilities and computing infrastructure&rdquo;, function as an inter-governmental organization, involve labs in partner countries, run programs for visiting researchers, run its own European PHD and MSc program,and give researchers the ability to found startups based on IP they generate. The ELLIS Lab should aim to secure long-term funding commitment on the order of a decade and should &ldquo;offer permanent employment to outstanding individuals early on&rdquo;.&nbsp; Signatories: The letter includes prominent European researchers as well as some notable other signatories, like Cedric Villani (the head of the French AI commission) as well as Richard Zemel, Research Director of the Vector Institute in Toronto. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read the ELLIS summary here. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read the ELLIS open letter here (PDF).
