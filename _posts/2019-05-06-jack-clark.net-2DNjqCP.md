excerpt: "Think your agents have general intelligence? Test them on MineRL:&hellip;Games as procedural simulators&hellip;How can we get machines to learn to perform complicated, lengthy sequences of actions? One way is to have these machines learn from human demonstrations &ndash; this captures a hard AI challenge, in the form of requiring algorithms that can take in a demonstration as input but generalize to different situations. It also short-cuts another hard AI challenge: exploration, which is the art of designing algorithms that can explore enough of the problem space they can attempt to solve the task, rather than get stuck enroute.&nbsp; Now, an interdisciplinary team of researchers led by people from Carnegie Mellon University have created the MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors. This competition uses the &lsquo;Minecraft&rsquo; computer game as a testbed in which to train smart algorithms, and ships with a dataset called MineRL-v0 which consists of 60 million state-action pairs of human demonstrations of tasks being solved within MineCraft.
The Challenge: MineRL will test the ability for agents to solve one main challenge: &lsquo;0btainDiamond&rsquo;, this challenge requires their agents to go and find a diamond somewhere in the (procedurally generated) environment they&rsquo;ve been dropped into. This is a hard task: &ldquo;Diamonds only exist in a small portion of the world and are 2-10 times rarer than other ones in Minecraft,&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;Additionally, obtaining a diamond requires many prerequisite items. For these reasons, it is practically impossible for an agent to obtain a diamond via naive random exploration&rdquo;.
Auxiliary Environments: 0btainDiamond is such a hard challenge that the competition organizers have released six additional &lsquo;auxiliary environments&rsquo; to help people train AI systems capable of solving the challenge. These are designed to encourage the development of several skills necessary to being able to easily find a diamond: navigating the environment, chopping down trees, surviving in the environment, and obtaining three different items &ndash; a bed (which needs to be assembled out of three items), meat (of a specific animal), and a pickaxe (which is needed to mine the diamond).
The dataset: MineRL-v0 is 60-million state-action-(reward) sets, recorded from human demonstrations. The state includes things like what the player sees as well as their inventory and distances to objectives and attributes and so on.
Release plans: The researchers aim to soon release the full environment, data, and numerous algorithmic baselines. They will also publish further details of the competition as well, which will encourage contestants to submit via &lsquo;NC6 v2&rsquo; instances on Microsoft&rsquo;s &lsquo;Azure&rsquo; cloud.
Why this matters: MineCraft has many of the qualities that make for a useful AI research platform: its tasks are hard, the environments can be generated procedurally, and it contains a broad &amp; complex enough range of tasks to stretch existing systems. I also think that its inherently spatial qualities are useful, and potentially let researchers specify even harder tasks requiring systems capable of hierarchical learning and operating over long timescales.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: The MineRL Competition on Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning using Human Priors (Arxiv).

Who gets to decide the rules for AI?&hellip;Industry currently has too much power, says Harvard academic&hellip;The co-director for Harvard University&rsquo;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society is concerned that industry will determine the rules and regulations of AI, leading to significant societal ramifications. 
In an essay in Nature, Yochai Benkler writes that: &ldquo;Companies&rsquo; input in shaping the future of AI is essential, but they cannot retain the power they have gained to frame research on how their systems impact society or on how we evaluate the effect morally.&rdquo;
One solution: Benkler&rsquo;s main fix is to apply funding. &ldquo;Organizations working to ensure that AI is fair and beneficial must be publicly funded, subject to peer review and transparent to civil society. And society must demand increased public investment in independent research rather than hoping that industry funding will fill the gap without corrupting the process.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d note the challenge here is that many governments are loathe to invest in building their own capacity for technical evaluation, and tend to defer to industry inputs.
Why this matters: AI is sufficiently powerful to have political ramifications and these will have a wide-ranging effect on society &ndash; we need to ensure there is equitable representation here, and I think coming up with ways to do that is a worthy challenge.&nbsp; Read more: Don&rsquo;t let industry write the rules for AI (Nature).
