### Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth – Build Highly Accurate Datasets and Reduce Labeling Costs by up to 70% | Amazon Web Services

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. However, there is no deus ex machina: the learning process requires an algorithm (“how to learn”) and a training dataset (“what to learn from”). Today, most machine learning tasks use a technique […]
