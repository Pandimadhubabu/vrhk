excerpt: "Cybercrime is on the rise, and organizations across a wide variety of industries -- from financial institutions to insurance, health care providers, and large e-retailers -- are rightfully worried. In the first half of 2017 alone, over 2 billion records were compromised. After stealing PII (personally identifiable information) from these hacks, fraudsters can gain access to customer accounts, create synthetic identities, and even craft phony business profiles to commit various forms of fraud. Naturally, companies are frantically looking to beef up their security teams. But there’s a problem."
