excerpt: "Amazon's Alexa has long had games inspired by Batman, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Jeopardy, but today, as Echo Buttons go on sale for the first time, Amazon is introducing its first accessory for multiplayer gameplay. At launch, Echo Buttons work with voice app games like Fourth Down Football Trivia with Philip Rivers and Sounds Fun with Mike Epps. Developers will be able to incorporate Buttons into their own games and skills in the future. But Amazon doesn't just want its AI assistant to play voice-only games from the Alexa Skills Store with rudimentary Buttons."
