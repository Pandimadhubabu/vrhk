excerpt: "Auto-generating phishing URLs via AI components:&hellip;AI is an omni-use technology, so the same techniques used to spot phishing URLs can also be used to generate phishing URLs&hellip;Researchers with the Cyber Threat Analytics division of Cyxtera Technologies have written an analysis of how people might &ldquo;use AI algorithms to bypass AI phishing detection systems&rdquo; by creating their own system called DeepPhish.&nbsp;&nbsp;DeepPhish: DeepPhis works by taking in a list of fraudulent URLS that have been successfully worked in the past, encodes these as a one-hot representation, then trains a model to generate new synthetic URLs given a seed sentence. They found that DeepPhish could dramatically improve the chances of a fraudulent URL getting past automated phishing-detection systems, with DeepPhish URLs seeing a boost in effectiveness from 0.69% (no DeepPhish) to 20.90% (with DeepPhish). &nbsp;&nbsp;Security people always have the best names: DeepPhis isn&rsquo;t the only AI &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; system recently developed by researchers, the authors note; other tools include Honey-Phish, SNAP_R, and Deep DGA. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: This research highlights how AI is an inherent omni-use technology, where the same basic components used to, for instance, train systems to learn to spot potentially fraudulent URLS, can also be used to generate plausible-seeming fraudulent URLs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: DeepPhish: Simulating Malicious AI (PDF).
Curious about the future of reinforcement learning? Apply more curiosity!&hellip;Self-Imitation Learning, aka: That was good, let&rsquo;s try that again&hellip;Self-Imitation Learning (SIL) works by having the agent exploit its replay buffer by learning to repeat its own prior actions if they have generated reasonable returns previously and, crucially, only when those actions delivered larger returns than were expected. The authors combine SIL with Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) and test the algorithm out on a variety of hard tasks, including the notoriously tough Atari exploration game Montezuma&rsquo;s Revenge. They also report scores for games like Gravitar, Freeway, PrivateEye, Hero, and Frostbite: all areas where A2C+SIL beats A3C+ baselines. Overall, AC2+SIL gets a median score across all of Atari of 138.7%, compared to 96.1% for A2C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Robots: They also test a combination of PPO+SIL on simulated robotics tasks within OpenAI Gym and significantly boost performance relative to non-SIL baselines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparisons: At this stage it&rsquo;s worth noting that many other algorithms and systems have come out since A2C with better performance on Atari, so I&rsquo;m a little skeptical of the comparative metric here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: We need to design AI algorithms that can explore their environment more intelligently. This work provides further evidence that developing more sophisticated exploration techniques can further boost performance. Though, as the report notes, such systems can still get stuck in poor local optima. &ldquo;Our results suggest that there can be a certain learning stage where exploitation is more important than exploration or vice versa,&rdquo; the authors write. &ldquo;We believe that developing methods for balancing between exploration and exploitation in terms of collecting and learning from experiences is an important future research direction.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Self-Imitation Learning (Arxiv).
