### Retro Contest

We're launching a transfer learning contest that measures a reinforcement learning algorithm's ability to generalize from previous experience. In typical RL research, algorithms are tested in the same environment where they were trained, which favors algorithms which are good at memorization and have many hyperparameters. Instead, our contest tests an
