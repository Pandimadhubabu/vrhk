excerpt: "In this post, I create an intent in Amazon Lex for a translation action. This intent prompts the user for a source and target language, for example English to Spanish, followed by a text string to translate. Users are free to switch languages at any time during the interaction with Amazon Lex. The solution in the following illustration makes full use of Serverless Computing technologies to enable seamless scaling to thousands of users without the need for further engineering effort."

This intent prompts the user for a source and target language, for example English to Spanish, followed by a text string to translate. Users are free to switch languages at any time during the interaction with Amazon Lex. The solution in the following illustration makes full use of Serverless Computing technologies to enable seamless scaling to thousands of users without the need for further engineering effort.
