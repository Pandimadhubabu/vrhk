excerpt: "In the early days of DeepMind Health, we met with clinicians at the Royal Free Hospital in London who wanted to know if AI could improve care for patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is notoriously difficult to spot, and can result in serious illness or even death if left untreated. AKI is currently detected by applying a mathematical formula (called the AKI algorithm) to NHS patients’ blood tests. This algorithm is good, but it’s widely known that it isn’t perfect. For example, it has a tendency to generate false positives for patients with chronic (as opposed to acute) kidney disease. It’s also insensitive to whether the patient has been admitted to hospital for two hours or two weeks, or whether the patient is eight years old or 92 years old - all of which makes a difference."
