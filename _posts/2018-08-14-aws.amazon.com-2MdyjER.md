excerpt: "Memsource is always looking out for exciting new integrations that enhance its cutting-edge translation solutions. With machine translation (MT) continuing to be a hot topic in the localization industry, Memsource is focusing on integrating with innovative MT engines that meet customers’ growing MT needs. In particular, Memsource strives to offer neural machine translation (NMT) engines, such as Amazon Translate. NMT is proving to be a highly influential technology. The quality of NMT output continues to improve, making it a powerful productivity tool and therefore more in demand. Amazon Translate, with its deep learning methods, has started to make its mark in the translation and localization industry. It’s become a priority to add it to Memsource’s range of MT engines. It is also a natural fit for existing AWS customers. Another draw is that the engine aligns with Memsource’s enterprise focus, particularly B2C. Amazon Translate is built on Amazon’s expertise in consumer products and communication, and the localization problems they have solved using machine translation."
