excerpt: "Today, the iPhone X became available in Apple retail stores across the globe. And given the fanfare around iPhone launches for the past decade, we couldn&rsquo;t help but show up and chat with one of the world&rsquo;s most loyal consumer fan bases.
At Apple&rsquo;s 5th Avenue Manhattan store, lines stretched down the block and across Madison Avenue, with some pre-order folks arriving only a couple of hours before opening, while others (without a pre-order reservation) arriving early morning yesterday.
Most seemed pretty excited about the new model iPhone, though, as buyers who wait in line, that&rsquo;s to be expected. Check out the reactions in the video above."

### On iPhone X launch day, Apple draws a crowd

Today, the iPhone X became available in Apple retail stores across the globe. And given the fanfare around iPhone launches for the past decade, we couldn&rsquo;t help but show up and chat with one of the world&rsquo;s most loyal consumer fan bases.
At Apple&rsquo;s 5th Avenue Manhattan store, lines stretched down the block and across Madison Avenue, with some pre-order folks arriving only a couple of hours before opening, while others (without a pre-order reservation) arriving early morning yesterday.
Most seemed pretty excited about the new model iPhone, though, as buyers who wait in line, that&rsquo;s to be expected. Check out the reactions in the video above.
