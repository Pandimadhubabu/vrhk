excerpt: "African AI researchers would like better code switching, maps, to accelerate research:&hellip;The research needs of people in Eastern Africa tells us about some of the ways in which AI development will differ in that part of the world&hellip;Shopping lists contain a lot of information about a person, and I suspect the same might be true of scientific shopping lists that come from a particular part of the world. For that reason a paper from Caltech which outlines requests for machine learning research from members of the East African Tech Scene gives us better context when thinking about the global impact of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research needs: Some of the requests include:
Support for code-switching within language models; many East Africans rapidly code-switch (move between multiple languages during the same sentence) making support for multiple languages within the same model important.
Named Entity Recognition with multiple-use words; many English words are used as names in East Africa, eg &ldquo;Hope, Wednesday, Silver, Editor&rdquo;, so it&rsquo;s important to be able to learn to disambiguate them.
Working with contextual cues; many locations in Africa don&rsquo;t have standard addressing schemes so directions are contextual (eg, my house is the yellow one two miles from the town center) and this is combined with numerous misspellings in written text, so models will need to be able to fuse multiple distinct bits of information to make inferences about things like addresses.
Creating new maps in response to updated satellite imagery to help augment coverage of the East African region, accompanied by the deliberate collection of frequent ground-level imagery of the area to account for changing businesses, etc.
Due to poor internet infrastructure, spotty cellular service, and the fact &ldquo;electrical power for devices is carce&rdquo; one of the main types of request is for more efficient systems, such as models that are designed to run on low-powered devices, and on thinking about ways to add adaptive learning to processes involving surveying so that researchers can integrate new data on-the-fly to make up for its sparsity.Reinforcement learning, what reinforcement learning? &ldquo;No interviewee reported using any reinforcement learning methods&rdquo;.&nbsp; Why it matters; AI is going to be developed and deployed globally, so becoming more sensitive to the specific needs and interests of parts of the world underrepresented in machine learning should further strengthen the AI research community. It&rsquo;s also a valuable reminder that many problems which don&rsquo;t generate much media coverage are where the real work is needed (for instance, supporting code-switching in language models). &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Some Requests for Machine Learning Research from the East African Tech Scene (Arxiv).
DeepMap nets $60 million for self-driving car maps:
&hellip;Mapping startup raises money to sell picks and shovels for another resource grab&hellip;A team of mapmakers who previously worked on self-driving-related efforts at Google, Apple, and Baidu, have raised $60 million for DeepMap, in a Series B round.
