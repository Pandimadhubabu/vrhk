### Use the built-in Amazon SageMaker Random Cut Forest algorithm for anomaly detection | Amazon Web Services

Today, we are launching support for Random Cut Forest (RCF) as the latest built-in algorithm for Amazon SageMaker. RCF is an unsupervised learning algorithm for detecting anomalous data points or outliers within a dataset. This blog post introduces the anomaly detection problem, describes the Amazon SageMaker RCF algorithm, and demonstrates the use of the Amazon […]
