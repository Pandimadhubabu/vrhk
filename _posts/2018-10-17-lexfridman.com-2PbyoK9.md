excerpt: "Steven Pinker is a professor at Harvard and before that was a professor at MIT. He is the author of many books, some of which have had a big impact on the way I see the world for the better. In particular, The Better Angels of Our Nature and Enlightenment Now have instilled in me a sense of optimism grounded in data, science, and reason. Video version is available on YouTube.
