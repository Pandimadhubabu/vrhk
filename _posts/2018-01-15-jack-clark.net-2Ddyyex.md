excerpt: "Urban flaneurs generate fake cities with GANs:&hellip;Researchers discover same problems that AI researchers have been grappling with, like those relating to interpretability and transparency&hellip;Researchers have used generative adversarial networks to generate a variety of synthetic, fictitious cities. The project shows that &ldquo;a basic, unconstrained GAN model is able to generate realistic urban patterns that capture the great diversity of urban forms across the globe,&rdquo; they write. This isn&rsquo;t particularly surprising since we know GANs can typically approximate the distribution of the data they are fed on &ndash; though I suspect the dataset (30,000 images) might be slightly too small to do away with things like over-fitting. &nbsp;&nbsp;Date used: The Global Urban Footprint, an inventory of built-up land at 12m/px resolution, compiled by the German Aerospace Center. &nbsp;&nbsp;Questions: It&rsquo;s always instructive to see the questions posed by projects that sit at the border between AI and other disciplines, like geography. For this project, some open questions the researchers are left with include: &ldquo;How to evaluate the quality of model output in a way that is both quantitative, and interpretable and intuitive for urban planning analysis? How to best disentangle, explore, and control latent space representations of important characteristics of urban spatial maps? How to learn from both observational and simulated data on cities?,&rdquo; and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more here: Modeling urbanization patterns with generative adversarial networks (Arxiv).
The ImageNet of video (possibly) arrives:&hellip;MIT&rsquo;s &lsquo;Moments in Time&rsquo; dataset consists of one million videos, each of which is 3 seconds long&hellip;Much of the recent progress in machine learning has been driven in part by the availability of large-scale datasets providing a sufficiently complex domain to stress-test new scientific approaches against. MIT&rsquo;s new &lsquo;moments in time&rsquo; dataset might just be the dataset we need for video understanding, as it&rsquo;s far larger than other available open source datasets (eg activitynet, kinetics, UCF, etc), and also has a fairly broad set of initial labels (339 verbs linked to a variety of different actions or activities.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Video classification baselines: The researchers also test the new dataset on a set of baselines based on systems that use techniques like residual networks, optical flow, and even sound (via usage of a SoundNet network). These baselines get top-5 accuracies of as high as 50% or so, which means that at least one selection within five proffered by the system is correct. The best performing approach is a &lsquo;temporal relation network&rsquo; (TRN). This network attained a score of about 53% and was trained on RGB frames using the InceptionV3 image classification architecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;Next:&ldquo;Future versions of the dataset will include multi-labels action description (i.e. more than one action occurs in most 3-second videos), focus on growing the diversity of agents, and adding temporal transitions between the actions that agents performed,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read more: Moments in time dataset: one million videos for event understanding (Arxiv).
Ugly robots no more: Unity gets a MuJoCo plugin:&hellip;Tried-and-tested physics simulator gets coupled to a high-fidelity game engine&hellip;Developers keen to improve the visual appearance of their AI systems may be pleased to know that MuJoCo has released a plugin for the Unity engine. This will let developers import MuJoCo models directly into Unity then visualize them in snazzier environments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The workflow we envision here is closer to the MuJoCo use case: the executable generated by Unity receives MuJoCo model poses over a socket and renders them, while the actual physics simulation and behavior control take place in the user&rsquo;s environment running MuJoCo Pro,&rdquo; write the authors.&nbsp; Read more here: MuJoCo Plugin and Unity Integration.
Google censors itself to avoid accidental racism:&hellip;Search company bans search terms to protect itself against photos triggering insulting classifications&hellip;A little over two years ago Google&rsquo;s Google Photos application displayed an appalling bug: searches for &lsquo;gorillas&rsquo; would bring up photos of black people. There was a swift public outcry and Google nerfed its application so it wouldn&rsquo;t respond to those terms. Two years later, despite ample progress in AI and machine learning, nothing has changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Google spokesperson confirmed that &ldquo;gorilla&rdquo; was censored from searches and image tags after the 2015 incident, and that &ldquo;chimp,&rdquo; &ldquo;chimpanzee,&rdquo; and &ldquo;monkey&rdquo; are also blocked today. &ldquo;Image labeling technology is still early and unfortunately it&rsquo;s nowhere near perfect,&rdquo; the spokesperson wrote in an email, highlighting a feature of Google Photos that allows users to report mistakes,&rdquo; Wired reports.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read here: When it comes to Gorillas, Google Photos Remains Blind (Wired).
The first ever audiobook containing a song generated by a neural network?&hellip;&rsquo;Sourdough&rsquo; by Robin Sloan features AI-imagined Croatian folk songs&hellip;Here&rsquo;s a fun blog post by author Robin Sloan about using AI (specifically, SampleRNN) to generate music for his book.

Miri blows past its 2017 funding target thanks to crypto riches:&hellip;Crypto + AI research, sitting in a tree, S-Y-N-E-R-G-I-Z-I-N-G!&hellip;The Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley has raised over $2.5 million with its 2017 fundraiser, with a significant amount of funding coming from the recent boom in cryptocurrencies. &nbsp;&nbsp;66% of funds raised during this fundraiser were in the form of cryptocurrency (mainly Bitcoin and Ethereum),&rdquo; Miri writes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read more here: Fundraising success!

Amazon turns to GANS to simulate e-commerce product demand&hellip; and it sort of works!&hellip;As if the e-retailer doesn&rsquo;t have enough customers, now it&rsquo;s inventing synthetic ones&hellip;Researchers with Amazon&rsquo;s Machine Learning team in India have published details on eCommerceGAN, a way to use GANs to generate realistic, synthetic customer and customer order data. This is useful because it lets you test your system for the vast combinatorial space of possible customer orders and, ideally, get better at predicting how new products will match with existing customers, and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The orders which have been placed in an e-commerce website represent only a tiny fraction of all plausible orders. Exploring the space of all plausible orders could provide important insights into product demands, customer preferences, price estimation, seasonal variations etc., which, if taken into consideration, could directly or indirectly impact revenue and customer satisfaction,&rdquo; the researchers write. &nbsp;&nbsp;The eCommerce GAN (abbreviated to &lsquo;ecGAN&rsquo;) lets the researchers create a synthetic &ldquo;dense and low-dimensional representation of e-commerce orders&rdquo;. They also create an eCommerce-conditional-GAN (ec^2GAN), which lets them &ldquo;generate the plausible orders involving a particular product&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Results: The researchers created a 3D t-SNE map of both real customer orders and GAN-generated ones. The plots showed a strong correlation between the two with very few outliers, suggesting that their ecGAN approach is able to generate data that falls within the distribution of what e-retailers actually see. To test the the ec^2GAN they see if it can conditionally generate orders that have similar customerproduct profiles to real orders &ndash; and they succeed. It might sound a…"
