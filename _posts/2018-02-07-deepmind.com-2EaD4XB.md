### IMPALA: Scalable Distributed DeepRL in DMLab-30 | DeepMind

Our latest paper introduces IMPALA (Importance-Weighted Actor-Learner), a new and efficient distributed architecture capable of solving many tasks at the same time. We also introduce DMLab-30, a new set of visually-unified environments designed using our open source RL tool DeepMind Lab that we use to test IMPALA and other architectures.
