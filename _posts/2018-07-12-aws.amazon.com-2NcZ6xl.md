### Build multiclass classifiers with Amazon SageMaker linear learner | Amazon Web Services

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for scalable training and hosting of machine learning models. We’re adding multiclass classification support to the linear learner algorithm in Amazon SageMaker. Linear learner already provides convenient APIs for linear models such as logistic regression for ad click prediction, fraud detection, or other classification problems, and linear regression […]
