### Amazon SageMaker DeepAR now supports missing values, categorical and time series features, and generalized frequencies. | Amazon Web Services

Today we are launching several new features for DeepAR in Amazon SageMaker. DeepAR is a supervised machine learning algorithm for time series prediction, or forecasting, that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to produce probabilistic forecasts. Since its launch, the algorithm has been used for a variety of use cases. We are excited to give developers access to new […]
