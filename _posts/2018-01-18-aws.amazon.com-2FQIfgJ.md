### Amazon SageMaker BlazingText: Parallelizing Word2Vec on Multiple CPUs or GPUs | Amazon Web Services

Today we’re launching Amazon SageMaker BlazingText as the latest built-in algorithm for Amazon SageMaker. BlazingText is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating Word2Vec embeddings. These are dense vector representations of words in large corpora. We’re excited to make BlazingText, the fastest implementation of Word2Vec, available to Amazon SageMaker users on: Single CPU instances (like the […]
