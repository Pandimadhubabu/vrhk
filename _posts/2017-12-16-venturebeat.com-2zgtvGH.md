excerpt: "Self-driving cars were once thought of as a far-off, and maybe even impossible, concept, but they're here now. At the end of November, General Motors announced its plan to launch a fleet of driverless cars -- without backup drivers -- across several major U.S. cities, beginning in 2019. In doing so, the auto industry signified that it's prepared to lead a dramatic shift in how both humans and commercial goods move from place to place."

### Harnessing data from driverless cars to improve transportation

Self-driving cars were once thought of as a far-off, and maybe even impossible, concept, but they're here now. At the end of November, General Motors announced its plan to launch a fleet of driverless cars -- without backup drivers -- across several major U.S. cities, beginning in 2019. In doing so, the auto industry signified that it's prepared to lead a dramatic shift in how both humans and commercial goods move from place to place.
