### Google’s AI generates videos with ‘unprecedented complexity’

Generating videos from whole cloth isn’t anything new for neural networks, or layers of mathematical functions modeled after biological neurons — researchers last week described a machine learning system capable of hallucinating clips from start and end frames alone. But because of the inherent randomness, complexity, and information denseness of videos, modeling realistic ones at …
