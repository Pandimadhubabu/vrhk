### Block-Sparse GPU Kernels

We’re releasing highly-optimized GPU kernels for an underexplored class of neural network architectures: networks with block-sparse weights. Depending on the chosen sparsity, these kernels can run orders of magnitude faster than cuBLAS or cuSPARSE. We've used them to attain state-of-the-art results in text sentiment analysis and generative modeling of
