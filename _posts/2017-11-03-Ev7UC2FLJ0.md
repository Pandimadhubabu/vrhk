Moments into the tutorial encounter that teaches you these basic inputs, I remembered that the Xbox One controller has a "correct" way to use the bumpers that makes it a lot easier to use. And I want to share that with you before your index fingers shrivel up and die from misuse."

### For Assassin’s Creed: Origins, you’re holding the Xbox One gamepad the wrong way

After taking a year off, Ubisoft is back with another Assassin's Creed, and this time the default combat controls are wack. I only just started the Egyptian open-world adventure on Xbox One, so maybe it just takes some time to see the wisdom in putting block and attack on the left and right bumpers, respectively. Moments into the tutorial encounter that teaches you these basic inputs, I remembered that the Xbox One controller has a "correct" way to use the bumpers that makes it a lot easier to use. And I want to share that with you before your index fingers shrivel up and die from misuse.
