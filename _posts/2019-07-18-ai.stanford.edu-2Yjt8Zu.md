### Adaptive Energy-Efficient Routing for Autonomous Vehicles

We introduce the problem of real-time routing for an autonomous vehicle that can use multiple modes of transportation through other vehicles in the area. We also propose a scalable and performant planning algorithm for solving such problems.
