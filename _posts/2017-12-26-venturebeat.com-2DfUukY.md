excerpt: "Amazon doesn't disclose Echo sales numbers, but a key external metric suggests that the company's smart speakers are having a great 2017 holiday season. On Christmas Day, Amazon's Alexa app took the #1 spots on both the U.S. Google Play and iPhone App Stores' free app charts, reflecting plenty of fresh Android and iOS user demand for the software used to set up Echo speakers. The #1 rankings placed Alexa ahead of perennially popular apps such as Facebook Messenger, YouTube, and Spotify, no easy feat for an app dependent upon a hardware purchase."
