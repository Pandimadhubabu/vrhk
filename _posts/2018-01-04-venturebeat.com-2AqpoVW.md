### How invisible AI shapes our brand relationships

Picture this. It's Monday morning, and your alarm clock wakes you up at 7:40 a.m. It's given you an extra 15 minutes in bed, responding to data it received from your phone about your quality of sleep. Before you ask, Alexa has switched on the lights in the bathroom and is playing your morning bulletin. As you finish brushing your teeth, you hear the coffee machine start to bubble away in the kitchen. You open the fridge, finish the last of the milk in your coffee, and see a notification come in saying that more milk will be arriving today in your grocery delivery. Your personal assistant reminds you that you have three meetings today, and for once you'll need dress smartly. It suggests three items from your wardrobe that would be suitable.
