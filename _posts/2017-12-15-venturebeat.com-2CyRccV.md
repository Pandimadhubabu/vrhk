excerpt: "I first met Otto Berkes when he was one of the founders of Microsoft's Xbox team, alongside three other crazy Microsoft colleagues. They hatched a crazy scheme to get Microsoft in the console business, and now it's a multibillion-dollar enterprise. I wrote a book about them and the work they did as intrapreneurs, or a team creating a startup within a big company. And many years later, Berkes is still focused on innovation and intrapreneurship."

### How CA Technologies is brewing startups within a big enterprise

I first met Otto Berkes when he was one of the founders of Microsoft's Xbox team, alongside three other crazy Microsoft colleagues. They hatched a crazy scheme to get Microsoft in the console business, and now it's a multibillion-dollar enterprise. I wrote a book about them and the work they did as intrapreneurs, or a team creating a startup within a big company. And many years later, Berkes is still focused on innovation and intrapreneurship.
