### Training models with unequal economic error costs using Amazon SageMaker | Amazon Web Services

Many companies are turning to machine learning (ML) to improve customer and business outcomes. They use the power of ML models built over “big data” to identify patterns and find correlations. Then they can identify appropriate approaches or predict likely outcomes based on data about new instances. However, as ML models are approximations of the […]
