excerpt: "AI-powered surveillance might sound like the plot of a Spielberg film, but the technology is no longer science fiction. Machine learning is used to improve facial recognition algorithms, allowing law enforcement and first responders to quickly and accurately obtain information during an emergency. The technology is already in use in many public spaces and in the newest crop of home security devices."
