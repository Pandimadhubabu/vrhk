excerpt: "Chinese company seeks smarter robots with &lsquo;DRIVE&rsquo; dataset:&hellip;Crowds? Check. Trashcan-sized robots? Check. A challenging navigation and mapping benchmark? Check&hellip;Researchers with Chinese robot company Segway Robotics Inc have developed the &lsquo;DRIVE&rsquo; dataset and benchmark, which is designed to help researchers develop smarter delivery robots.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company did the research because it wants to encourage research in an area relevant to its business, and because of larger macroeconomic trends: &ldquo;The online shopping and on-demand food delivery market in China has been growing at a rate of 30%-50% per year, leading to labor shotage and rising delivery cost,&rdquo; the researchers write. &ldquo;Delivery robots have the potential to solve the dilemma caused by the growing consumer demand and decreasing delivery workforce.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Robots! Each Segway robot used to gather the dataset is equipped with a RealSense visual inertial sensor, two wheel encoders, and a Hokuyuo 2D lidar.&nbsp;
The DRIVE dataset: The dataset consists of 100 movement sequences across five different indoor locations, and was collected by robots over the course of one year. It is designed to be extremely challenging, and incorporates the following confounding factors and traits:
Commodity, aka cheap, inertial measurement units

Busy: The gathered data includes scenes with many moving people and objects, which can break brittle AI systems

Similar, similar: Some of the environments are superficially similar to eachother, which could trigger misclassification. Additionally, some of the places in the environments lack texture or include numerous reflections and shadows, making it harder for robots to visually analyze their environment. Additionally, some of the environments have bumpy or rough surfaces.

Hurry up and wait: Some of the datasets include long sequences in which the robot is stationery (which makes it difficult to estimate depth), while at other times the robots perform rapid rotations (which can lead to motion blur and wheels slipping on the ground).&nbsp;
Why this matters: Datasets unlock AI progress, letting large numbers of people work together on shared challenges. Additionally, the creation of datasets usually imply specific business and research priorities, so the arrival of things like the DRIVE Benchmark point to broader maturation in smart, mobile robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Segway DRIVE Benchmark: Place Recognition and SLAM Data Collected by A Fleet of Delivery Robots (Arxiv).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find out more about the benchmark here (Segway DRIVE website).

You&rsquo;ve heard of face identification. What about Primate face identification?&hellip;Towards a future where we automatically scan and surveil the world around us&hellip;Researchers with the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi and the Wildlife Institute of India have teamed up to develop a system capable of identifying monkeys in the wild and have linked this to a crowd-sourced app, letting the &ldquo;general public, professional monkey catchers and field biologists&rdquo; crowd source images of monkeys for training larger, smarter models.&nbsp;
Why do this? Monkeys are a bit of a nuisance in Indian urban and semi-urban environments, the researchers write, so have designed the system to use data captured &lsquo;in the wild&rsquo;, helping people build systems to surveil and analyze primates in challenging contexts. &ldquo;Typically, we expect the images to be captured in uncontrolled outdoor scenarios, leading to significant variations in facial pose and lighting&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Datasets:&nbsp;
Rhesus Macaque Dataset: 7679 images / 93 individuals.&nbsp;
Chimpanzee Dataset: 7166 images / 90 primates. Pictures span good quality images from a Zoo, as well as uncontrolled images from a national park.
Results: The system outperforms a variety of baselines and sets a new state of the art across four validation scores, typically via a greater than 2 point absolute increase in performance, and sometimes via as much as a 6 or greater point increase. Their system is trained with a couple of different loss functions designed to capture smaller geometric features across faces, making the model more robust across multiple data distributions.&nbsp;
Why this matters: This research is an indication of how as AI has matured we&rsquo;ve started to see it being used as a kind of general-purpose utility, with researchers mixing and matching different techniques and datasets, making slight tweaks, and solving tasks for socially relevant applications. It&rsquo;s particularly interesting to see this approach integrated with a crowd sourced app, pointing to a future where populations are able to collaboratively measure, analyze, and quantify the world around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Primate Face Identification in the Wild (Arxiv).&nbsp;

What Recursion&rsquo;s big dataset release means for drug discovery:&hellip;RxRx1 dataset designed to encourage &ldquo;machine learning on large biological datasets to impact drug discovery and development&rdquo;&hellip;Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a company that uses AI for drug discovery, has released RxRx1, a 296GB dataset consisting of 125,510 images across 1,108 classes; an ImageNet-scale dataset, except instead of containing pictures of cats and dogs it contains pictures of human cells, to help scientists train AI systems to observe patterns across them, and generate insights for drug development.&nbsp;
The challenges of biology: Biological datasets can be challenging for image recognition algorithms due to variation across cell samples, and other factors present during data sampling, such as temperature, humidity, reagent concentration and so on. RxRx1 contains data from 51 instances of the same experiment, which should help scientists develop algorithms that are robust to the changes across experiments, and are thus able to learn underlying patterns in the data.
What parts of AI research could RxRx1 help with? Recursion has three main ideas:
Generalization: The dataset is useful for refining techniques like transfer learning and domain adaptation.
Context Modeling: Each RxRx1 image ships with a detailed metadata, so researchers can experiment with this as an additional form of signal.&nbsp;
Computer Vision: RxRx1 &ldquo;presents a very different data distribution than is found in most publicly available imaging datasets,&rdquo; Recursion writes. &ldquo;These differences include the relative independence of many of the channels (unlike RGB images) and the fact that each example is one of a population of objects treated similarly as opposed to singletons.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Why this matters: We&rsquo;re entering an era where people will start to employ large-scale machine learning to revolutionize medicine; tracking usage of datasets like RxRx1 and the results of a planned NeurIPS 2019 competition will help give us a sense of progress here and what it might mean for medicine and drug design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: RxRx1 official website ().

Why AI could leave people with disabilities behind:&hellip;Think bias is a problem now?

People with disabilities could have trouble accessing the benefits of AI systems due to issues of fairness and bias inherent to machine learning, according to a position paper from researchers with Microsoft and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. To deal with some of these issues, they propose a research agenda to help remedy these shortcomings in AI systems. T…"
