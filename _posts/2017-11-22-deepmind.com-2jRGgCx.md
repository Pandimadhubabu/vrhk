excerpt: "In October we announced that our state-of-the-art speech synthesis model WaveNet was being used to generate realistic-sounding voices for the Google Assistant. Our latest paper introduces details of this “parallel WaveNet” model and the techniques we used to allow it to run on Google infrastructure at more than 1000 times the speed of the original WaveNet."

In October we announced that our state-of-the-art speech synthesis model WaveNet was being used to generate realistic-sounding voices for the Google Assistant. Our latest paper introduces details of this “parallel WaveNet” model and the techniques we used to allow it to run on Google infrastructure at more than 1000 times the speed of the original WaveNet.
