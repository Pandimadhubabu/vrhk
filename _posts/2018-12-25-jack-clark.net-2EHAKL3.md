excerpt: "Microsoft shares the secrets of XiaoIce, its popular Chinese chatbot:&hellip;Real-world AI is hybrid AI&hellip;Many people in the West are familiar with Tay, a chatbot developed by Microsoft and launched onto the public internet in early 2016, then shortly shutdown after people figured out how to compromise the chatbot&rsquo;s language engine and make it turn into a &ndash; you guessed it &ndash; Nazi Racist. What people are probably less familiar with is XiaoIce, a chatbot Microsoft launched in China in 2014 which has since become one of the more popular chatbots deployed worldwide, having communicated with over 660 million users since its launch.&nbsp; What is XiaoIce? XiaoIce is &ldquo;an AI companion with which users form long-term, emotional connections&rdquo;, Microsoft researchers explain in a new paper describing the system. &ldquo;XiaoIce aims to pass a particular form of Turing Test known as the time-sharing test, where machines and humans coexist in a companion system with a time-sharing schedule.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chatbot has three main components: IQ, EQ, and Personality. The IQ component involves specific dialogue skills, like being able to answer questions, recommend questions, tell stories, and so on. EQ has two main components: empathy, which involves predicting traits about the individual user XiaoIce is conversing with; and social skills, which is about personalizing responses to the user. Personality: &ldquo;The XiaoIce persona is designed as a 18-year-old girl who is always reliable, sympathetic, affectionate, and has a wonderful sense of humor,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp; How do you optimize a chatbot? Microsoft optimizes XiaoIce for a metric called Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS) &ndash; this represents &ldquo;the average number of conversation-turns between the chatbot and the user in a conversational session&rdquo;. The idea is that high numbers here correspond to a lengthy conversation, which seems like a good proxy for user satisfaction (mostly). XiaoIce is structured hierarchically, so it tracks the state of the conversation and selects from various skills and actions so that it can optimize responses over time.&nbsp; Data dividends for Microsoft: Since launching in 2014, XiaoIce has generated more than 30 billion conversation pairs (as of May 2018); this illustrates how powerful AI apps can themselves become generators of significant datasets, ultimately obviating dependence on so much external data. &ldquo;Nowadays, 70% of XiaoIce responses are retrieved from her own past conversations,&rdquo; they write.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hybrid-AI: XiaoIce doesn&rsquo;t use a huge amount of learned components, though if you read through the system architecture it&rsquo;s clear that neural networks are being used for certain aspects of the technology &ndash; for instance, when responding to a user, XiaoIce may use a &lsquo;neural response generator&rsquo; (based on a GRU-RNN) to come up with potential verbal responses, or it may use a retrieval-based system to tap into an external knowledge store. It also uses learned systems for other components, like its ability to analyze images and extract entities from them then use this to talk with or play games with the user &ndash; though with a twist of trying to be personalized to the user.&nbsp; Just how big and effective is XiaoIce? Since launching in 2014 XiaoIce has grown to become a platform supporting a large set of other chatbots, beyond XiaoIce itself: &ldquo;These charactrs include more than 60,000 official accounts, Lawson and Tokopedia&rsquo;s customer service bots, Pokemon, Tencent and Neatease&rsquo;s chatbots&rdquo; and more, Microsoft explained.
Since launching XiaoIce&rsquo;s CPS &ndash; the proxy for engagement from users &ndash; has grown from a CPS of 5 in version 1, to a CPS of 23 in mid-2018.&nbsp; Why this matters: As AI industrializes we&rsquo;re starting to see companies build systems that hundreds of millions of people interact with, and which grow in capability over time. These products and services give us one of the best ways to calibrate our views about how AI will be deployed in the wild, and what AI technologies are robust enough for prime time.&nbsp; Jack&rsquo;s highly-speculative prediction: I&rsquo;d encourage people to go and check out Figure 19 in the paper, which gives an overview of the feature growth within XiaoIce since launch. Though the chatbot today is composed of a galaxy of different services and skills, many of which are hand-crafted by humans and a minority of which are learned via neural techniques, it&rsquo;s also worth remembering that as usage of XiaoIce grows Microsoft will be generating vast amounts of data about how users interact with all these systems, and will also be generating metadata about how all these systems interact on a non-human infrastructure level. This means Microsoft is gathering the sort of data you might need to train some fully learned end-to-end XiaoIce-esque prototype systems &ndash; these will by nature by pretty rubbish compared to the primary system, but could be interesting from a research perspective.&nbsp; Read more: The Design and Implementation of XiaoIce, an Empathetic Social Chatbot (Arxiv).
