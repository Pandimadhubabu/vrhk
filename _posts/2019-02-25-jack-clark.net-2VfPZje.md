excerpt: "Researchers take a LEAF out of Google&rsquo;s book with evolutionary ML system:&hellip;In the future, some companies will have researchers, and some will spend huge $$$ on compute for architecture search&hellip;Researchers with startup Cognizant Technology Solutions have developed their own approach to architecture search, using insights from one of the paper authors Risto Miikkulainen, inventor of the NEAT and HyperNEAT approaches.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;They outline a technology called LEAF (Learning Evolutionary AI Framework) which uses an algorithm called CoDeepNEAT (an extension of NEAT) to let it evolve the architecture and hyperparameters. &ldquo;Multiobjective CoDeepNEAT can be used to maximize the performance and minimize the complexity of the evolved networks simultaneously,&rdquo; the authors write. It also has some middleware software to let it spreads jobs over Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or the Google Cloud.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Results: The authors test their approach on two tasks: classifying Wikipedia comments for Toxicity, and learning to analyze chest x-rays for the purpose of multitask image classification. For Wikipedia, they find that LEAF can discover architectures that outperform the state-of-the-art score on Kaggle, albeit at the cost of about &ldquo;9000 hours of CPU time&rdquo;. In the case of chest X-ray classification, LEAF is able to get to within a fraction of a percentage point of state-of-the-art.
&nbsp; Why this matters:&nbsp;Systems like LEAF show the relationship between compute spending and ultimate performance of trained models, and suggests that some AI developers could consider under-investing in research staff and instead investing in techniques where they can arbitrage compute against researcher-time, delegating the task of network design and fine-tuning to machines instead of people.\&nbsp; Read more: Evolutionary Neural AutoML for Deep Learning (Arxiv).
Want to prevent your good AI system being used for bad purposes? Consider a RAIL license:&hellip;Responsible AI Licenses designed to give open source developers more control over what happens with their technology&hellip;RAIL provides a source code license and an end-user license &ldquo;that developers can include with AI software to restrict its use,&rdquo; according to the RAIL website. &ldquo;These licenses include clauses for restrictions on the use, reproduction, and distribution of the code for potentially harmful domain applications of the technology&rdquo;.
&nbsp; &nbsp;RAIL licenses are designed to account for the omni-use nature of AI technology, which means that &ldquo;the same AI tool that can be used for faster and more accurate cancer diagnoses can also be used in powerful surveillance system&rdquo;, they write. &ldquo;This lack of control is especially salient when a developer is working on open-source ML or AI software packages, which are foundational to a wide variety of the most beneficial ML and AI applications.&rdquo;
&nbsp; &nbsp;How RAIl works: The RAIL licenses work by restricting AI and ML software from being used in a specific list of harmful applications, e.g. in surveillance and crime prediction, while allowing for other applications.
&nbsp; &nbsp;Who is behind it? RAIL is being developed by AI researchers, a patent attorney/computer program, and Brent Hecht a professor at Northwestern University and one of the authors of the ACM Future of Computing Academy essay &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Time to Do Something: Mitigating the Negative Impacts of Computing Through a Change to the Peer Review Process&rsquo; (ACM FCA website).
&nbsp; &nbsp;Why this matters: The emergence of licensing schemes like this speaks to the anxieties that some people feel about how AI technology is being used or applied today. If licenses like these get adopted and are followed by users of the technology, then it gives developers a non-commercial way to (slightly) control how their technology is used. Unfortunately, approaches like RAIL will not work against malicious actors, who are likely to ignore any restrictions in a particular software license when carrying out their nefarious activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Responsible AI Licenses (RAIL site).

NAIL, short for Navigate, Acquire, Interact and Learn, is software that consists of several specialized &lsquo;decision modules&rsquo; as well as an underlying knowledge graph. NAIL won the 2018 Text Aventure AI Competition, and a readthrough of the paper highlights just how much human knowledgeable is apparently necessary to solve text adventure games, given the widespread use of specialized &ldquo;decision modules&rdquo; to help it succeed at the game.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions, decisions, decisions: NAIL has these four main decision modules:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Examiner: Tries to identify new objects seen in the fiction to add to NAIL&rsquo;s knowledge graph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoarder: Tries to &ldquo;take all&rdquo; objects seen at a point in time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interactor: Tries to figure out what actions to take and how to take them.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Navigator: Attempts to apply one of twelve actions (eg, &lsquo;enter&rsquo;, or &lsquo;South&rsquo;) to move the player.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;And even more decisions: It also has several even more specialized ones, which are designed to kick-in in the event of things like in-game darkness, needing to emit a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; response following a prompt, using regular expressions to parse game responses for hints, and what they call idler which will try random combinations of verb phrases combined with nearby in-game objects to try and un-stick the agent.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;All about the Knowledge: While NAIL explores the world, it builds a knowledge graph to help it learn about its gameworld. It organizes this knowledge graph autonomously and extends it over time. Additionally, having a big structured store of information makes debugging easier: &ldquo;by comparing the knowledge graph to the published map for well documented games like Zork, it was possible to track down bugs in NAIL&rsquo;s decision modules&rdquo;.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Why this matters: In the long-term, most AI researchers want to develop systems where the majority of the components are learned. Systems like NAIL represent a kind of half-way point between where we are today and the future, with researchers using a lot of human ingenuity to chain together various systems, but trying to force learning to occur via various carefully specified functions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read more: NAIL: A General Interactive Fiction Agent (Arxiv).
