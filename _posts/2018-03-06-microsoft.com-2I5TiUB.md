### Sequence Intent Classification Using Hierarchical Attention Networks - Developer Blog

We analyze how Hierarchical Attention Neural Networks could be helpful with malware detection and classification scenarios, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach for generic sequence intent analysis. The novelty of our approach is in applying techniques that are used to discover structure in a narrative text to data that describes the behavior of executables.
