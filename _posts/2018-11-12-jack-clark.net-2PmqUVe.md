excerpt: "Want almost ten million images for machine learning? Consider Open Images V4:&hellip;Latest giant dataset release from Google annotates images with bounding boxes, visual relationships, and image-level labels for 20,000 distinct concepts&hellip;Google researchers have released Open Images Dataset V4, a very large image dataset collected from photos from Flickr that had been shared with a Creative Commons Attribution license.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale: Open Images V4 contains 9.2 million heavily-annotated images. Annotations include bounding boxes, visual relationship annotations, and 30 million image-level labels for almost 20,000 distinct concepts. &ldquo;This [scale] makes it ideal for pushing the limits of the data-hungry methods that dominate the state of the art,&rdquo; the researchers write. &ldquo;For object detection in particulate, the scale of the annotations is unprecedented&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Automated labeling: &ldquo;Manually labeling a large number of images with the presence or absence of 19,794 different classes is not feasible not only because of the amount of time one would need, but also because of the difficulty for a human to learn and remember that many classes&rdquo;, they write. Instead, they use a partially-automated method to first predict labels for images, then have humans provide feedback on these predictions. They also implemented various systems to more effectively add the bounding boxes to different images, which required them to train human annotators in a technique called &ldquo;fast clicking&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale, and Google scale: The 20,000 class names selected for use in Open Images V4 are themselves a subset of all the names used by Google for an internal dataset called JFT, which contains &ldquo;more than 300 million images&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: In recent years, the release of new, large datasets has been (loosely) correlated with the emergence of new algorithmic breakthroughs that have measurably improved the efficiency and capability of AI algorithms. The large-scale and dense labels of Open Images V4 may serve to inspire more progress in other work within AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the data: Open Images V4 (Official Google website). &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: The Open Images Dataset V4 (Arxiv).
What happens when plane autopilots go bad:&hellip;Incident report from England gives us an idea of how autopilots bug-out and what happens when they do&hellip;A new incident report from the UK about an airplane having a bug with its autopilot gives us a masterclass in the art of writing bureaucratic reports about terrifying subjects. &nbsp;&nbsp;The report in full: &ldquo;After takeoff from Belfast City Airport, shortly after the acceleration altitude and at a height of 1,350 ft, the autopilot was engaged. The aircraft continued to climb but pitched nose-down and then descended rapidly, activating both the &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T SINK&rsquo; and &ldquo;PULL UP&rdquo; TAWS (EGPWS) warnings. The commander disconnected the autopilot and recovered the aircraft into the climb from a height of 928 ft. The incorrect autopilot &lsquo;altitude&rsquo; mode was active when the autopilot was engaged causing the aircraft to descend toward a target altitude of 0 ft. As a result of this event the operator has taken several safety actions including revisions to simulator training and amendments to the taxi checklist.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: AAIB investigation to DHC-8-402 Dash 8, G-ECOE (UK Gov, Air Accidents Investigation Branch).
China&rsquo;s Xi Jinping: AI is a strategic technology, fundamental to China&rsquo;s rise:&hellip;Chinese leader participates in Politburo-led AI workshop, comments on its importance to China&hellip;Chinese leader Xi Jinping recently led a Politburo study session focused on AI, as a continuation of the country&rsquo;s focus on the subject following the publication of its national strategy last year. New America recently translated Chinese-language official media coverage of the event, giving us a chance to get a more detailed sense of how Xi views AI+China. &nbsp;&nbsp;AI as a &ldquo;strategic technology&rdquo;: Xi described AI as a strategic technology, and said it is already imparting a significant influence on &ldquo;economic development, social progress, and the structure of international politics and economics&rdquo;, according to remarks paraphrased by state news service Xinhua. &ldquo;Accelerating the development of a new generation of AI is an important strategic handhold for China to gain the initiative in global science and technology competition&rdquo;.&nbsp; AI research imperatives: China should invest in fundamental theoretical AI research, while growing its own education system. It should &ldquo;fully give rein to our country&rsquo;s advantages of vast quantities of data and its huge scale for market application,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;AI and safety: &ldquo;It is necessary to strengthen the analysis and prevention of potential risks in the development of AI, safeguard the interests of the people and national security, and ensure that AI is secure, reliable, and controllable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Leading cadres at all levels must assiduously study the leading edge of science and technology, grasp the natural laws of development and characteristics of AI, strengthen overall coordination, increase policy support, and form work synergies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why it matters: Whatever the United States government does with regard to artificial intelligence will be somewhat conditioned by the actions of other countries, and China&rsquo;s actions will be of particular influence here given the scale of the country&rsquo;s economy and its already verifiable state-level adoption of AI technologies. I believe it&rsquo;s also significant to have such detailed support for the technology emanate from the top of China&rsquo;s political system, as it indicates that AI may be becoming a positional geopolitical technology &ndash; that is, state leaders will increasingly wish to demonstrate superiority in AI to help send a geopolitical message to rivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Xi Jinping Calls for &lsquo;Healthy Development&rsquo; of AI [Translation] (New America).
Manchester turns on SpiNNaker spiking neuron supercomputer:&hellip;Supercomputer to model biological neurons, explore AI&hellip;Manchester University has switched on SpiNNaker, one-million processor supercomputer designed with a network architecture to help it better model biological neurons in brains, specifically by implementing spiking networks. SpiNNaker &ldquo;mimics the massively parallel communication architecture of the brain, sending billions of small amounts of information simultaneously to thousands of different destinations&rdquo;, according to Manchester University.&nbsp; Brain-scale modelling: SpiNNaker&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to model one billion neurons at once. One billion neurons are about 1% of the total number of neurons in the average human brain. Initially, it should be able to model around a million neurons &ldquo;with complex structure and internal dynamics&rdquo;. But SpiNNaker boards can also be scaled down and used for other purposes, like in developing robotics. &ldquo;A small SpiNNaker board makes it possible to simulate a network of tens of thousands of spiking neurons, process sensory input and generate motor output, all in real time and in a low power system&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Why it matters: Many researchers are convinced that if we can figure out the right algorithms, spiking networks are a better approach to AI than today&rsquo;s neural networks &ndash; that&rsquo;s because a spiking network can propagate messages that are both fuzzier and more complex than those made possible by traditional networks.&nbsp; Read more: &lsquo;Human brain&rsquo; supercomputer with 1 million processors switched on for first time (Manchester). &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: SpiNNaker home page (Manchester University Advanced Processor Technol…"
