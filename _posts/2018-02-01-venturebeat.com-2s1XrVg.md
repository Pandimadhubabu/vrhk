excerpt: "The transportation industry is on the verge of unprecedented change. Slowly but surely, city and state governments, municipalities, and transportation agencies are introducing technologies powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies connect our streets and highways with highly automated vehicles, mass transit systems, and other roadside infrastructure. The promise of these technologies is safer and more efficient travel that improves citizens' quality of life. But, as with any new technology, there is a downside."
