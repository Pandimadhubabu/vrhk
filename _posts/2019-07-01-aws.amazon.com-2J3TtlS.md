### Associating prediction results with input data using Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform | Amazon Web Services

When you run predictions on large datasets, you may want to drop some input attributes before running the predictions. This is because those attributes don’t carry any signal or were not part of the dataset used to train your machine learning (ML) model. Similarly, it can be helpful to map the prediction results to all […]
