excerpt: "Understanding an agent’s specific cognitive skill set may prove useful for improving its overall performance, but the complexity of a tasks in AI research can often make it difficult to tease apart individual skills. We believe it is possible to draw on experimental methods from fields like cognitive psychology to better understand the behaviours of artificial agents. That is why we developed Psychlab, a platform built on top of DeepMind Lab, which allows us to directly apply methods from these fields to study behaviours of artificial agents in a controlled environment. We are also open-sourcing this platform for others to use."
