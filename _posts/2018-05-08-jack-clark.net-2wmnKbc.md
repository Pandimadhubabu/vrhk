excerpt: "Classifying trees with a DJI drone and a lot of patience:&hellip;Consumer-grade drones shown to be able to gather necessarily detailed data for tree species classification&hellip;Japanese researchers have shown that consumer-grade drone cameras are of sufficient quality to gather RGB images of trees and use these to train an AI model to distinguish between different species.&nbsp; Details: The researchers gathered their data via a drone test flight in late 2016 in the forest located in the the Kamigamo Experimental Station in Kyoto, Japan. They used a commodity consumer drone (a DJI Phantom 4) alongside proprietary software for navigation (DroneDeploy) and image editing (Agisoft Photoscan Professional). &nbsp;&nbsp;Results: The resulting trained model can classify five of a possible six types of tree with close to 90%+ accuracy. The researchers improved the performance of the classifier by copying and augmenting the input data.&nbsp; Why it matters: One of the most powerful aspects of modern AI is its ability to perform effective classification of anything you can put together a training dataset for. Research like this points to a future where drones and other robots are use to periodically scan and classify the world around us, offering us new capabilities in areas like flora and fauna management, disaster response, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Automatic classification of trees using a UAV onboard camera and deep learning (Arxiv).
What does AGI safety research man and who is doing it?&hellip;What AI safety is, how the field is progressing, and where it&rsquo;s going next&hellip;Researchers at Australian National University (including Marcus Hutter) have surveyed the field of artificial intelligence providing an overview of the differences and overlaps between various AGI initiatives. The paper also contains a distillation of why people bother to work on AI safety: &ldquo;if we want an artificial general intelligence to pursue goals that we approve of, we better make sure that we design the AGI to pursue such goals: Beneficial goals will not emerge automatically as the system gets smarter,&rdquo; the researchers write.&nbsp; Problems, problems everywhere: The paper includes a reasonably thorough overview of the different AGI safety research agendas pursued by organizations like MIRI, OpenAI, DeepMind, the Future of Life Institute, and so on. The tl;dr: there are lots of distinct problems relating to AI safety, and OpenAI and DeepMind teams have quite a lot of overlap in terms of research specializations. &nbsp;&nbsp;Policy puzzles: &ldquo;It could be said that public policy on AGI does not exist,&rdquo; the researchers write, before noting that there are several preliminary attempts at creating AI policy (including the recent &lsquo;Malicious Actors&rsquo; report), while observing that much of the current public narrative (the emergence of an AI arms race between US and China) runs counter to most of the policy suggestions put forward by the AI community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: AGI Safety Literature Review (Arxiv).
Why your next Alibaba delivery could be arranged by an AI:&hellip;Chinese researchers show how to learn effective bin-packing&hellip;Chinese researchers with the Artificial Intelligence Department of Zhejiang Cainiao Supply Chain Management Co. achieved state-of-the-art results on a 3D pin-packing problem (BPP) via the use of multi-task learning techniques. In this work, they try to define a system that can figure out the optimum way to stack objects to fit into a box whose proportions can also be learned and specified by the algorithm. BPP might sound boring &ndash; after all, this is the science of packing things in boxes &ndash; but it&rsquo;s a crucial task to logistics and e-retail, so figuring out systems to adaptively learn to do packing of arbitrary numbers of goods in an optimal way seems useful. &nbsp;&nbsp;Data: The researchers gather the data from an unnamed E-commerce platform and logistics platform (though one of the researchers is from Alibaba, so there&rsquo;s a high likelihood the data comes from there) to create a dataset consisting of 15,000 training items and 15,000 testing items, spread across orders that involve 8, 10, and 12 distinct items.&nbsp; Approach: They structure the problem as a sequence-to-sequence one, with item descriptions being fed as input to an LSTM encoder with the decoder output corresponding to the item details and the orientation in the box. &nbsp;&nbsp;Resuts: Models trained by the researchers obtain substantially higher accuracy than prior baselines, though not many people publicly compete in this area yet so I&rsquo;m unsure as to how progress will change over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: A Multi-task Selected Learning Approach for Solving New Type 3D Bin Packing Problem (Arxiv).
Facebook auto-translation option into Messenger:&hellip;&rdquo;M Translations&rdquo; feature will let people converse across language gaps&hellip;Facebook has added automatic translation to Facebook Messenger. Translation like this may generate new business opportunities for the company &ndash; &ldquo;at launch, M translations will translate from English to Spanish (and vice-versa) and be available in Marketplace conversations between buyers and sellers in the United States,&rdquo; the company said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Read more: Messenger at F8 &ndash; App review re-opens, New products for Businesses and Developers launch (FB Messenger blog).
A neural net to understand and approximate the Universe:&hellip;Particle physics collides with artificial intelligence&hellip;Harvard researchers show how they use neural networks to analyze the movements of particles in jets. Neural networks are useful tools to apply to analyzing multi-variant problems like these, because they can learn to compute the probability distribution generating the data they observe, and therefore over time generate an interpretation of the forces governing system.&nbsp; &ldquo;We scaffold the neural network architecture around a leading-order description of the physics underlying the data, from first input all the way to final output. Specifically, we base the JUNIPR framework on algorithmic jet clustering trees,&rdquo; they explain. &ldquo;The JUNIPR framework yields a probabilistic model, not a generative model. The probabilistic model allows us to directly compute the probability density of an individual jet, as defined by its set of constituent particle momenta&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Results: The scientists use the JUNIPR model to better analyze and predict patterns in the streams of data generated by large-scale physics experiments, and to potentially approximate things for which we have a poor understanding of the underlying system, like analyzing heavy ion collisions.&nbsp; Read more: JUNIPR: a Framework for Unsupervised Machine Learning in Particle Physics (Arxiv).
Google researchers report reasonable sim2real transfer learning:&hellip;Researchers cross the reality gap with domain randomization, high-fidelity simulation, and clever Minitaur robots&hellip;Google researchers have trained a simple robot to walk within a simulation then transferred this learned behavior onto a real-world robot. This is a meaningful achievement in the field of applying modern AI techniques to robotics, as frequently policies learned in simulation will fail to successfully transfer to the real world.&nbsp; The researchers use &ldquo;Minitaur&rdquo; robots, four-legged machines capable of walking, running, jumping, and so on. They frame the problem of learning to walk as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) because certain states, like the position of the Minitaur&rsquo;s base or the foot contact forces, are not accessible due to a lack of sensors. The Google researchers achieve their transfer feat by increasing the resolution of their physics simulator, and applying several domain randomization techniques to expose the trained models to enough variety th…"
